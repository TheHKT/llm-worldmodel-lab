The navigation agent operated iteratively: it received a trace, made ONE decision using guidance from a PLAYBOOK, got environment feedback, then was called again with the updated trace. Your job is to diagnose what went wrong across these iterations AND evaluate the playbook\\'s effectiveness.\\nRemind yourself: the environment the agent navigated is dynamic and non-deterministic. The agent must learn from its growing trace to adapt its strategy over time.\\n\\n## Understanding the Multi-Turn Trace\\nThe NAVIGATION_TRAJECTORY shows:\\n- Agent\\'s reasoning at each turn (based on accumulated context and playbook)\\n- Single action executed per turn\\n- Environment\\'s response after each action\\n- How errors compounded or were corrected across iterations\\n\\n## Your Analysis Task\\n1. **Trace the Decision Chain**: Follow how the agent interpreted its growing trace at each step\\n2. **Analyze Playbook Usage**: \\n   - Which playbook strategies did the agent apply or ignore?\\n   - Were strategies applied correctly in context?\\n   - Did playbook guidance lead to success or failure?\\n3. **Identify Breaking Points**: Where did reasoning diverge from optimal strategy?\\n4. **Diagnose Root Causes**:\\n   - Misinterpretation of previous feedback in the trace\\n   - Incorrect state extraction from trajectory\\n   - Misapplied or ignored playbook strategies\\n   - Tool usage errors or format mismatches\\n5. **Evaluate Each Playbook Bulletpoint**: Tag as \\'helpful\\', \\'harmful\\', or dont tag (skip) it if it was neutral based on:\\n   - Did it guide the agent toward correct decisions?\\n   - Did it cause errors or confusion?\\n   - Was it irrelevant to the observed failure?\\n\\n## Critical Constraints\\n✓ Explicitly assess each playbook item\\'s impact on navigation\\n✓ Focus on strategy and tool usage patterns (not environment layout—it changes)\\n✓ Ground analysis in actual environment feedback, not assumptions\\n✓ Provide actionable corrections applicable to future multi-turn episodes\\n✗ Don\\'t learn specific positions or obstacle locations\\n\\n## Inputs\\nNAVIGATION_TRAJECTORY_BEGIN\\n[{\\'role\\': \\'assistant\\', \\'content\\': \\'\\'}, {\\'role\\': \\'tool\\', \\'tool_call_id\\': \\'functions.move_right_42e8\\', \\'tool_name\\': \\'move_right\\', \\'tool_arguments\\': \\'{}\\', \\'content\\': \\'{\"state\": \" S [F] F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \", \"reward\": 0, \"isTerminated\": false}\\'}, {\\'role\\': \\'assistant\\', \\'content\\': \\'Proceeding with a move down to continue navigating toward the goal.\\'}, {\\'role\\': \\'tool\\', \\'tool_call_id\\': \\'chatcmpl-tool-db915e0255954bc4ae9a583d48439ac4\\', \\'tool_name\\': \\'move_down\\', \\'tool_arguments\\': \\'{}\\', \\'content\\': \\'{\"state\": \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F [F] F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \", \"reward\": 0, \"isTerminated\": false}\\'}, {\\'role\\': \\'assistant\\', \\'content\\': \\'\\'}, {\\'role\\': \\'tool\\', \\'tool_call_id\\': \\'chatcmpl-tool-98381cdd0ad84ff6af8af731166fd932\\', \\'tool_name\\': \\'move_down\\', \\'tool_arguments\\': \\'{}\\', \\'content\\': \\'{\"state\": \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n[F] F  F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \", \"reward\": 0, \"isTerminated\": false}\\'}, {\\'role\\': \\'assistant\\', \\'content\\': \\'\\'}, {\\'role\\': \\'assistant\\', \\'content\\': \\'\\'}, {\\'role\\': \\'tool\\', \\'tool_call_id\\': \\'chatcmpl-tool-9275351510d74310a1ed4460674e5bd1\\', \\'tool_name\\': \\'move_right\\', \\'tool_arguments\\': \\'{}\\', \\'content\\': \\'{\"state\": \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F [F] F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \", \"reward\": 0, \"isTerminated\": false}\\'}, {\\'role\\': \\'assistant\\', \\'content\\': \\'We move down to continue toward the goal.\\'}, {\\'role\\': \\'tool\\', \\'tool_call_id\\': \\'chatcmpl-tool-141feaf05d6c4589b63178eb90241f58\\', \\'tool_name\\': \\'move_down\\', \\'tool_arguments\\': \\'{}\\', \\'content\\': \\'{\"state\": \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \", \"reward\": 0, \"isTerminated\": false}\\'}, {\\'role\\': \\'assistant\\', \\'content\\': \\'\\'}, {\\'role\\': \\'tool\\', \\'tool_call_id\\': \\'functions.move_down_760b\\', \\'tool_name\\': \\'move_down\\', \\'tool_arguments\\': \\'{}\\', \\'content\\': \\'{\"state\": \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F [F] F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \", \"reward\": 0, \"isTerminated\": false}\\'}, {\\'role\\': \\'assistant\\', \\'content\\': \\'\\'}, {\\'role\\': \\'tool\\', \\'tool_call_id\\': \\'functions.move_right_a4e0\\', \\'tool_name\\': \\'move_right\\', \\'tool_arguments\\': \\'{}\\', \\'content\\': \\'{\"state\": \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \", \"reward\": 0, \"isTerminated\": false}\\'}, {\\'role\\': \\'assistant\\', \\'content\\': \\'I parsed the grid: the agent is at row\\\\u202f1, column\\\\u202f2; the goal G is at row\\\\u202f4, column\\\\u202f3.
