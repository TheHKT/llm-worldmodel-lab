      "   - [1326dc23-065d-4f0f-8872-be525c72cd71] After each action, parse the returned state string line‑by‑line. Locate the pair of brackets \"[ ]\" that mark the agent’s current cell, count the lines from the top to get the row index and the characters between spaces to get the column index (using a consistent 0‑based or 1‑based convention). Update the internal position to these exact coordinates. If the observed position differs from the expected one, discard the current plan and recompute a safe path from the actual location. When a discrepancy is observed, record the specific action as *uncertain* (e.g., \"move_right behaved like move_down\") and treat future uses of that action as uncertain until re‑tested. Before issuing any move, verify that the intended target cell (based on the updated map) is free, and if an action is marked uncertain, first test it on a known safe neighboring cell to observe its actual effect before using it for progress.; helpful: 4, harmful: 2\n",

      "  \"reasoning\": \"The assistant began by interpreting the grid correctly but then repeatedly violated core navigation rules. It made multiple consecutive function calls without waiting for the environment feedback, ignored the one‑action‑per‑turn constraint, and failed to re‑parse the returned state after each move. Early on it discovered that move_right behaved unexpectedly (acting like move_up) but did not record this as an uncertain action nor test it on a safe neighbor before using it for progress. Later, after reaching (row 3, col 2) it issued move_down expecting to go to (4,2), but the environment responded by moving the agent left onto a hazard cell (row 3, col 1), causing termination. The assistant never adjusted its plan when the observed position differed from the expected one, nor did it treat move_down as uncertain after the first discrepancy. Consequently it stepped into a hazard and ended the episode.\\n\\nKey divergence points:\\n1. After the first move_right, the assistant noticed an unexpected position but did not log the action as uncertain.\\n2. It issued multiple moves in a row (e.g., move_right, move_right, move_right) without waiting for and incorporating each intermediate state.\\n3. It never re‑computed the path from the actual location after any discrepancy.\\n4. When move_down later behaved like move_left, the assistant still proceeded with the original plan, leading directly into a hazard.\\n\\nOverall, the assistant failed to apply the safe navigation strategy of continuous state parsing, discrepancy detection, and uncertainty handling, resulting in a lethal mis‑step.\",\n",
      "  \"error_identification\": \"The assistant misused the movement functions by chaining calls without waiting for feedback, ignored the observed discrepancies (e.g., move_right behaving like move_up, move_down behaving like move_left), and proceeded with a pre‑computed path that was no longer valid. This caused the agent to step onto a hazard cell and terminate the episode.\",\n",
      "  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The error stemmed from a conceptual misunderstanding of the playbook: the assistant did not treat unexpected action outcomes as *uncertain* and therefore did not test them before using them for progress. Additionally, it violated the rule of issuing only one action per turn, preventing proper state monitoring and replanning.\",\n",
      "  \"correct_approach\": \"1. After each action, immediately parse the returned state line‑by‑line to locate the \\\"[ ]\\\" brackets and update the exact (row, col) position. 2. Compare the observed position with the expected one; if they differ, label the invoked action as uncertain. 3. Before using an uncertain action again, test it on a known safe neighboring cell to confirm its actual effect. 4. Re‑plan a safe path from the current true position using only actions verified as reliable (or freshly tested). 5. Issue exactly one movement function per turn, wait for the environment response, and repeat the parsing/replanning loop until the goal is reached.\",\n",

So after move_down, agent is at row2 col1 (0-index row1, col0), okay.\\\\n\\\\nThen move_right: state returned:\\\\n\"[S] F  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \"\\\\n\\\\nNow bracket back at top left. So move_right from (row1,col0) went to (row0,col0) which is start again? That suggests move_right acted like move_up? Actually from row1 col0 moving right should go to col1 same row. But now it\\\\\\'s at [S] top left, which is (0,0). So move_right moved up. So move_right is incorrect/uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nNow move_up: state is same \"[S] F  F  F ...\" unchanged, so move_up did not change position, stayed at (0,0). So move_up might be no-op or also uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nThus we know: move_right behaved like move_up; move_up behaved like no movement (or maybe up from top row stays same). So our current position is (0,0).\\\\n\\\\nGoal is at bottom right (row4,col3 in 0-index). Need to find safe path. We need to test uncertain moves. According to playbook, if action uncertain, test it on known safe neighbor cell to see effect before using for progress.\\\\n\\\\nWe know move_down works correctly (since from start we moved down to (1,0) originally). move_left? We haven\\\\\\'t tried. move_up also works (stays same at top edge maybe). move_right is uncertain. Let\\\\\\'s test move_right on a different safe neighbor like from (0,0) maybe it goes up (invalid) or something. But we already observed behavior: from (0,0) move_right went to (0,0) because moved up staying same? Actually moving up from top row stays same. So move_right acted like move_up, which is no change. So move_right is not helpful.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to move toward goal: we can move down several times, then right. Need right movement. Since move_right is unreliable, we might try using move_left and move_up combos? But left from (0,0) maybe no change. we could test move_left to see effect.

It made multiple consecutive function calls without waiting for the environment feedback, ignored the one‑action‑per‑turn constraint, and failed to re‑parse the returned state after each move. Early on it discovered that move_right behaved unexpectedly (acting like move_up) but did not record this as an uncertain action nor test it on a safe neighbor before using it for progress. Later, after reaching (row\\u202f3, col\\u202f2) it issued move_down expecting to go to (4,2), but the environment responded by moving the agent left onto a hazard cell (row\\u202f3, col\\u202f1), causing termination. The assistant never adjusted its plan when the observed position differed from the expected one, nor did it treat move_down as uncertain after the first discrepancy. Consequently it stepped into a hazard and ended the episode.\\\\n\\\\nKey divergence points:\\\\n1. After the first move_right, the assistant noticed an unexpected position but did not log the action as uncertain.\\\\n2. It issued multiple moves in a row (e.g., move_right, move_right, move_right) without waiting for and incorporating each intermediate state.\\\\n3.

      "  \"reasoning\": \"The assistant began correctly by moving down from the start cell, but soon deviated from the prescribed safe‑navigation playbook. After the second move_right the agent was expected to be at (row 2, col 3) but the returned state showed the agent at (row 1, col 2). This discrepancy was not recognized; the assistant failed to label the move_right action as *uncertain* and did not discard the current plan. Instead it continued to use move_right (and later move_left and move_up) as if they behaved deterministically, issuing several actions in a row without fully parsing each feedback step. The assistant also did not test the uncertain actions on a known safe neighboring cell before using them for progress, violating the core bulletpoint from the playbook. Consequently the plan was built on incorrect assumptions about action effects, leading to a path that could not be reliably executed and ultimately to a termination in a hazardous cell. The later part of the trajectory shows the assistant finally re‑examining the map, but by then the model had already broken the one‑action‑per‑turn rule multiple times and ignored the uncertainty handling rules.\\n\\nIn summary, the main divergences were:\\n1. Failure to compare the observed position with the expected one after each move.\\n2. Not labeling move_right (and later move_left, move_up) as uncertain when they behaved unexpectedly.\\n3. Not testing uncertain actions on a safe neighbor before using them to advance toward the goal.\\n4. Issuing multiple movement calls without fully processing each turn’s feedback, violating the one‑action‑per‑turn constraint.\\n\\nThese mistakes prevented the assistant from maintaining an accurate internal state and from constructing a reliable safe path to the goal.\",\n",

      "  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Conceptual misunderstanding of the playbook: the model assumed deterministic actions and ignored the mandated uncertainty handling.

Let\\\\\\'s parse current state and position.\\\\n\\\\nThe latest state from move_up call: \\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n S  F  F  F \\\\n F  F [F] H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWe need to locate \"[ ]\". It\\\\\\'s at row 2? Let\\\\\\'s index rows starting from 1 top. Row1: \" S  F  F  F \". Row2: \" F  F [F] H \". So column3? Actually row2 has entries: F (col1), F(col2), [F] at col3, H at col4. So agent at (row2, col3). Goal G at bottom right row5 col4.\\\\n\\\\nWe have made many moves without waiting. Now we must continue correctly: one move at a time. Need to decide next move, considering unknown behavior: so far move_down went from (row1? Let\\\\\\'s see earlier moves: initial position appears at top left? Wait initial state: \"[S] F  F  F\". Actually initial state\\\\\\'s brackets around S? Provided: \"[S] F  F  F\". So starting at (row1,col1). Then move_down resulted in state with \"[F]\" at row2,col1 (since after move_down state: \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n[F] F  F  H ...\"). So move_down moved agent down correctly. Then move_right moved to row2,col2? Actually after first move_right, state shows \"[F]\" at row2,col2 (since row2: \" F [F] F  H\"). So correct. Next move_right again moved to row1,col3? Wait after second move_right state: \" S [F] F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H\". This indicates agent moved to row1,col2? Actually row1: \" S [F] F  F\". So after the second move_right, agent is at row1,col2. That suggests move_right while at row2,col2 moved up to row1,col2 (unexpected). So move_right is uncertain (behaves like move_up). Then move_left moved from row1,col2 back to row1,col2? Actually after move_left, state remained same: \" S [F] F  F\". So move_left did nothing? Actually still at row1,col2. So move_left may be uncertain or no effect.\\\\n\\\\nThen move_down moved from row1,col2 to row2,col2 (back). Then move_up moved from row2,col2 to row2,col3 (right). So move_up acted like move_right. So many uncertain behaviors.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to treat uncertain actions: move_right acted like move_up; move_up acted like move_right; move_left seemed no movement (maybe left doesn\\\\\\'t work). We need a safe path to goal using verified reliable actions, maybe move_down (still seems reliable) and move_left? Not sure.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to test uncertain actions on safe neighbor before reuse. Let\\\\\\'s evaluate reliable actions: So far move_down moved down correctly from (row1,col1) to (row2,col1) and later from (row1,col2) to (row2,col2) correctly. So move_down appears reliable (down).\\\\n\\\\nmove_up earlier from (row2,col2) went to (row2,col3) i.e., right, so move_up is uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nmove_right from (row2,col2) went to (row1,col2) i.e., up, uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nmove_left from (row1,col2) stayed same, uncertain, maybe no effect.\\\\n\\\\nThus we have only one reliable direction: down. We need to navigate to goal (row5,col4). We can only go down reliably. We can\\\\\\'t go right or left reliably. We could test move_up on a known safe cell to see its effect again. Maybe we can test move_up from a location where moving up is safe (non-hazard) to see outcome.\\\\n\\\\nWe must avoid hazards: grid with H at certain cells: row2,col4 (H), row3,col1 (H), row3,col4 (H), row4,col2 (H). Goal at row5,col4.\\\\n\\\\nWe are at (row2,col3). We need to get to col4. We might try move_up (uncertain) to go right; earlier move_up moved right. So we could use move_up to move right. But need to test on safe neighbor: from current (row2,col3) moving up would go to row1,col3 (which is F, safe). Let\\\\\\'s test move_up now and see effect. That will be one turn.\\\\n\\\\nWe should mark move_up as uncertain, but we can test to confirm behavior.

After the second move_right the agent was expected to be at (row\\u202f2,\\u202fcol\\u202f3) but the returned state showed the agent at (row\\u202f1,\\u202fcol\\u202f2). This discrepancy was not recognized; the assistant failed to label the move_right action as *uncertain* and did not discard the current plan. Instead it continued to use move_right (and later move_left and move_up) as if they behaved deterministically, issuing several actions in a row without fully parsing each feedback step. The assistant also did not test the uncertain actions on a known safe neighboring cell before using them for progress, violating the core bulletpoint from the playbook. Consequently the plan was built on incorrect assumptions about action effects, leading to a path that could not be reliably executed and ultimately to a termination in a hazardous cell. The later part of the trajectory shows the assistant finally re‑examining the map, but by then the model had already broken the one‑action‑per‑turn rule multiple times and ignored the uncertainty handling rules.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, the main divergences were:\\\\n1. Failure to compare the observed position with the expected one after each move.\\\\n2. Not labeling move_right (and later move_left, move_up) as uncertain when they behaved unexpectedly.\\\\n3. Not testing uncertain actions on a safe neighbor before using them to advance toward the goal.\\\\n4.

Then move_down: state shows \"[F]\" at row1 col1? Wait after move_down from row2 col2 they expected row3 col2, but result shows \"[F]\" at row1 col1?

Let\\\\\\'s test again from a different location e.g., (2,1) moving down again; we saw earlier that moving down from (2,1) gave back (2,1)? Actually initial move_down from start gave (2,1).

The state after third call (move_down) shows:\\\\n\\\\n\" S  F  F  F \\\\n[F] F  F  H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \"\\\\n\\\\nSo row1: \" S  F  F  F\". Row2: \"[F] F  F  H\". So position at row2 col1. So move_down from (row2,col2) ended up at (row2,col1) which is unexpected; move_down moved left? So move_down is uncertain. The assistant didn\\\\\\'t notice.\\\\n\\\\nNow after that, they called move_right, state shows position at row2 col2 again (back to original). Then move_right again moved to row2 col3 as expected. Then move_down moved back to row2 col2 (again uncertain). Then they attempted to test move_right again, but then they called move_up (instead?), got position at row2 col2 still? Actually after move_up call, feedback shows position at row2 col2? Let\\\\\\'s see: state after move_up:\\\\n\\\\n\" S  F  F  F \\\\n F  F [F] H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \"\\\\n\\\\nThat is row2 col3 (since row1 S line, row2 \" F  F [F] H\").\\\\n\\\\nSo move_up from (row2,col2) moved to (row2,col3) which is also unexpected; move_up moved right.\\\\n\\\\nThus many actions are uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to reset and apply safe navigation: after each move, compare expected vs observed, label uncertain, test uncertain actions on a known safe neighbor before using for progress.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to determine current safe known moves: we have observed that move_right from (row2,col1) moved to (row2,col2) (expected). And move_right from (row2,col2) moved to (row2,col3) (expected). So move_right seems reliable? Actually when at (row2,col2) after uncertain move_down back to same, move_right gave expected (2,3). So move_right seems reliable.\\\\n\\\\nBut move_down is uncertain (behaves left). Move_up is uncertain (behaves right). So we should avoid using down/up for progress, unless we test on a safe neighbor.\\\\n\\\\nGoal at (5,4). Need to get to row5 col4.\\\\n\\\\nWe are currently at (row2,col3). Let\\\\\\'s confirm: row2 col3 is observed after move_up. Yes.\\\\n\\\\nNow we should plan using only move_right as progress horizontally; for vertical movement we need a reliable action. None of down/up are reliable yet; but we can test them on a safe neighbor to see effect.\\\\n\\\\nWe can test move_down from a known safe cell, perhaps (row2,col3) is safe? It is free cell. Let\\\\\\'s test move_down to see where it goes; that will label uncertain and then we can consider using it for progress if we know its effect (it moves left maybe). Then we can plan accordingly.\\\\n\\\\nWe must issue one action per turn. So first, test move_down.\\\\n\\\\n\\'}]), {\\'role\\': \\'tool\\', \\'tool_call_id\\': \\'chatcmpl-tool-35267edec9424954b097064fe6e50928\\', \\'content\\': \\'{\"state\": \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F [F] H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \", \"reward\": 0, \"isTerminated\": false}\\'}, ChatCompletionMessage(content=\\'\\', refusal=None, role=\\'assistant\\', annotations=None, audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=[ChatCompletionMessageFunctionToolCall(id=\\'chatcmpl-tool-94cd7ec89a5248b5b3fb6eda058c3b47\\', function=Function(arguments=\\'{}\\', name=\\'move_down\\'), type=\\'function\\', index=0)], reasoning=\\'We have a problem: The assistant made multiple tool calls in one turn, violating rules.

      "  \"reasoning\": \"The assistant began correctly by moving down and right, but after the second move_down the observed position (row 2 col 1) differed from the expected position (row 3 col 2). The assistant failed to notice this discrepancy, did not label the move_down action as *uncertain*, and continued issuing further moves without parsing the returned state after each call. Moreover, it issued multiple function calls in a single turn, violating the one‑action‑per‑turn rule. Because the uncertain move_down was later used as part of a plan, the agent was steered into a hazard cell (row 3 col 4) and the episode terminated with a negative reward. The core issues were: (1) not parsing and comparing the state after each action, (2) not marking actions that behaved unexpectedly as uncertain, (3) not testing uncertain actions on a known safe neighbor before using them for progress, and (4) ignoring the safe‑navigation playbook that mandates these checks.\",\n",
      "  \"error_identification\": \"The assistant mis‑applied the navigation strategy by (a) issuing more than one movement function per turn, (b) skipping the mandatory parsing step after each move, (c) failing to detect that move_down behaved unexpectedly (left instead of down) and therefore not marking it as uncertain, (d) proceeding with a plan that relied on the unreliable move_down, and (e) ultimately moving into a hazard cell because the path was planned assuming deterministic actions.\",\n",
      "  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The root cause was a conceptual misunderstanding of how to handle uncertainty: the assistant did not follow the playbook rule that any divergence between expected and observed positions must immediately label the action as uncertain, abort the current plan, and re‑evaluate. This led to a cascade of unverified moves and the final fatal collision with a hazard.\",\n",
      "  \"correct_approach\": \"1. After each movement call, read the returned `state` string line‑by‑line, locate the `[ ]` brackets, and record the exact row/column. 2. Compare this observed coordinate with the coordinate that the chosen action should have produced. 3. If they differ, mark that specific action as *uncertain* and discard any plan that relies on it. 4. Test any uncertain action on a known safe neighboring cell before using it for progress (e.g., from (2,2) call move_down and note that it moves left). 5. Build a path to the goal using only actions proven reliable (move_right was reliable in this run). 6. Issue exactly one movement function per turn, wait for feedback, and repeat the verification loop until the goal is reached.\",\n",
      "  \"key_insight\": \"In uncertain environments, the only safe way to advance is to verify the outcome of *every* action before trusting it; any mismatch must immediately reclassify the action as uncertain and force a re‑plan.

Wait after move_down from row2 col2, moving down should go to row3 col2. But state shows [F] at row2 col1 again. That indicates move_down didn\\\\\\'t behave as expected. It might have moved up? Actually from row2 col2, moving down would be row3 col2, but state shows row2 col1; weird. The environment might be uncertain: move_down did something uncertain. The returned state after second move_down is same as after first move_down (row2 col1). That suggests move_down moved left? No, position changed from row2 col2 to row2 col1, which is left. So move_down acted as left maybe. Uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nThus we need to label move_down as uncertain. Also we need to recompute safe path from actual location (row2 col1). And need to test uncertain action on safe neighbor before using for progress.\\\\n\\\\nNow we are at row2 col1 after that move. Need to parse current state: we have the same as after first move_down. So current position is row2 col1. Goal is located at row5 col4 (row5 col4). Need to find safe path. Grid with obstacles: H are hazards. Let\\\\\\'s reconstruct map with coordinates (rows 1-5, cols 1-4):\\\\n\\\\nRow1: col1 S (start) but now empty? Actually start cell is now free. Row1: S? but we are not there.\\\\nRow1: [S] or maybe S is static start marker but it\\\\\\'s not a hazard. The map shows \"S\" for start, \"F\" for free, \"H\" for hazard, \"G\" goal.\\\\n\\\\nCurrent state after last move shows:\\\\nRow1: \" S  F  F  F \"\\\\nRow2: \"[F] F  F  H \"\\\\nRow3: \" H  F  F  H \"\\\\nRow4: \" F  H  F  F \"\\\\nRow5: \" F  F  F  G \"\\\\n\\\\nThus free cells are all F except hazards at (3,1), (3,4), (4,2), (2,4). Good.\\\\n\\\\nGoal at (5,4). Our position (2,1). Need path: down, down, right, right, down maybe.\\\\n\\\\nBut need to account for uncertain actions. We know move_down behaved uncertainly (actually moved left). We need to test move_down on a known safe neighbor before using for progress. We have a safe neighbor maybe moving right from (2,1) to (2,2) using move_right, which seemed deterministic (right moved right earlier). We have observed move_right moved right as expected (from (2,1) to (2,2)). So move_right is reliable (so far). We need to test move_down on a safe neighbor: from (2,1) we could try move_down again and see effect; but that is uncertain. Better to test move_up maybe? we haven\\\\\\'t observed. But we can test move_down on a known safe neighbor: e.g., from (2,2) moving down to (3,2) expected. But we need to first move to (2,2). Already we are at (2,1). We could move_right to (2,2) (reliable). Then test move_down from (2,2).

Let\\\\\\'s test again from a different location e.g., (2,1) moving down again; we saw earlier that moving down from (2,1) gave back (2,1)? Actually initial move_down from start gave (2,1).

Both have helpful scores 7/1 and harmful scores 2/0. First bullet has some harmful perhaps due to overemphasis? It says \"If an action is marked uncertain, first test it on a known safe neighboring cell to observe its actual effect before using it for progress.\" That\\'s good. The bullet seems fine.\\n\\nSecond bullet basically repeats part. Might be redundant. Could merge but keep concise.\\n\\nPotential additions:\\n- Emphasize that every movement function must be called singly per turn, no multiple calls.\\n- Emphasize always re-parse after each move and compare; do not skip.\\n- Emphasize that after any uncertainty, you must abort the current plan entirely, not partially.\\n- Emphasize to test uncertain actions on a known safe neighbor BEFORE using them for progress, not after.\\n- Add bullet about tracking visited cells and not revisiting hazards.\\n\\nPotential modifications: The first bullet mentions \"After each action, immediately parse the returned state line‑by‑line, locate the \"[ ]\" brackets to obtain the exact row and column (using a consistent indexing convention), and update the internal position. Compare this observed position with the expected one; if they differ, label the invoked action as *uncertain*, discard the current plan, and recompute a safe path from the actual location. Before any move, verify that the intended target cell (based on the updated map) is free. If an action is marked uncertain, first test it on a known safe neighboring cell to observe its actual effect before using it for progress. **Importantly, issue exactly one movement function per turn and wait for the environment\\'s feedback before deciding the next action.**\"\\n\\nThat\\'s comprehensive already. Might need to split into two bulletpoints for clarity: one about \"Detecting uncertainty and aborting plan\" and another about \"Testing uncertain actions on safe neighbor before using\".\\n\\nThe second bullet is similar but maybe redundant. Could remove second bullet.\\n\\nAlso might add bullet about \"When testing an uncertain action on a safe neighbor, compare its observed effect to the intended effect and update your model of that action\\'s behavior accordingly.\"\\n\\nAdd bullet about \"If an action repeatedly behaves unexpectedly, treat it as unreliable and remove it from future plans.\"\\n\\nAlso possibly add bullet about \"Maintain a map of observed free cells and hazards; never move into a cell observed as hazard.\"\\n\\nBut that\\'s already implied.\\n\\nDecision: Remove second bullet as redundant. Add new bullet for \"When testing an uncertain action on a safe neighbor, record its actual displacement and adjust future expectations accordingly.\"\\n\\nAdd new bullet for \"Never assume an action that previously succeeded will continue to succeed; always verify after each execution.\"\\n\\nAdd new bullet for \"If an action\\'s behavior is inconsistent (different outcomes in different contexts), mark it as unreliable and avoid using it for progress.\"\\n\\nAdd bullet for \"If multiple actions are uncertain, prioritize testing them one at a time on safe cells before planning.\"\\n\\nWe already have bullet about testing uncertain action but not about updating model of that action. Add.\\n\\nProceed with tool calls.\\n\\nWe will:\\n\\n- REMOVE bullet id \\'3ebb3f7b-24b9-4a75-aace-80a149322379\\' because redundant.\\n\\n- ADD new bullet in \"Safe Navigation Strategies\" with content: \"When you test an uncertain action on a known safe neighboring cell, record the actual displacement observed; update your internal model of that action\\'s behavior and use this updated expectation for any future use of the same action.\"\\n\\n- ADD another bullet: \"Do not assume that an action that succeeded previously will behave the same in a new context; after every execution, compare the observed result with the expected one, and if they differ, re‑classify the action as uncertain even if it worked before.\"\\n\\n- ADD another bullet: \"If an action shows inconsistent outcomes across multiple tests, mark it as unreliable and exclude it from any future navigation plan.\"\\n\\nMake sure each ADD is separate.\\n\\nNow produce tool calls.'}])\n",

      "  \"reasoning\": \"The agent started correctly: it parsed the initial map, moved right from the start cell, parsed the returned state and confirmed the position moved to (row 1,col 2). It then moved down, parsed the state and confirmed the position moved to (row 2,col 2). A second right move was also parsed and confirmed, placing the agent at (row 2,col 3). At this point the plan to reach the goal was sound – the agent intended to move down three times and then right once. However, after issuing the next move_down the returned state showed the brackets around a hazard cell [H] at (row 2,col 4) and the episode terminated. The agent did not notice that the observed position (a hazard) differed from the expected position (down to (row 3,col 3)). It also did not label the move_down action as *uncertain* and therefore did not test the action on a known safe neighbor before using it for progress. Consequently the agent stepped onto a hazard and the episode ended prematurely.\",\n",
      "  \"error_identification\": \"The agent assumed the move_down action would behave deterministically after two successful uses and failed to verify the outcome of the third move_down. It did not compare the observed position ([H] at column 4) with the expected position (downwards), so it neither recognized the action as uncertain nor re‑tested it. This mis‑interpretation of the feedback caused the agent to step onto a hazard and terminate the episode.\",\n",
      "  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Conceptual misunderstanding of uncertainty: the agent over‑generalised from earlier successes and did not treat each action as potentially stochastic. It also omitted the required post‑action verification step for the final move, violating the playbook rule to label an action uncertain when the observed position differs from the expectation and to test uncertain actions on a safe neighbor first.\",\n",
      "  \"correct_approach\": \"1. After each move, parse the state and compare the bracketed cell with the expected position. 2. When the move_down from (row 2,col 3) returns a bracket on a different cell (here a hazard), label move_down as uncertain. 3. Before using move_down for further progress, test it on a known safe neighbor (e.g., from the current cell move_up then move_down back, or move_left then move_right) to observe its actual effect. 4. Upon discovering that move_down shifts right into a hazard, discard the current plan and recompute a safe path from the actual location, avoiding the hazardous direction. 5.

At this point the plan to reach the goal was sound – the agent intended to move down three times and then right once. However, after issuing the next move_down the returned state showed the brackets around a hazard cell [H] at (row\\u202f2,col\\u202f4) and the episode terminated. The agent did not notice that the observed position (a hazard) differed from the expected position (down to (row\\u202f3,col\\u202f3)).

After each move, parse the state and compare the bracketed cell with the expected position. 2. When the move_down from (row\\u202f2,col\\u202f3) returns a bracket on a different cell (here a hazard), label move_down as uncertain. 3. Before using move_down for further progress, test it on a known safe neighbor (e.g., from the current cell move_up then move_down back, or move_left then move_right) to observe its actual effect. 4.

      "  \"reasoning\": \"The assistant first inspected the grid and planned a safe path that required moving right twice, then down five times, and finally right once. It then issued a move_right call. The environment returned a state where the brackets \\\"[S]\\\" were still at the original start cell, indicating the agent had not moved. The assistant correctly recognized this as a deviation and labeled the action as uncertain. It then called move_down, which succeeded and moved the agent to (row 2, col 1). At this point the agent was at a known safe cell. The assistant intended to test the previously uncertain move_right on a safe neighboring cell before using it for progress, as prescribed by the playbook. However, before issuing the test move it failed to verify that the target cell of the right‑move from the current location (row 2, col 1) was free. It simply called move_right again, assuming it would move to (row 2, col 2). The environment instead moved the agent onto a hazard cell at (row 3, col 1) (the brackets now surround an \\\"H\\\"), terminating the episode. Thus the failure occurred because the assistant did not check the safety of the target cell before executing a move that had already shown uncertain behavior.\",\n",
      "  \"error_identification\": \"The assistant used move_right on a neighboring cell without first confirming that the destination was free. This violated the playbook rule to verify the intended target cell before any move, especially after an action has been marked uncertain. Consequently, the move_right placed the agent on a hazard and terminated the run.\",\n",
      "  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Conceptual misunderstanding of the uncertainty handling process: the assistant assumed that testing an uncertain action on any neighbor was sufficient, neglecting the explicit check that the neighbor cell is free. This led to an unsafe execution of move_right, turning an already uncertain action into a fatal mistake.\",\n",
      "  \"correct_approach\": \"1. After the first move_right returned the agent still at the start, label move_right as uncertain. 2. Re‑compute a safe path from the actual position (row 2, col 1). 3. Before using move_right again, inspect the map and confirm that the cell to the right of the current position (row 2, col 2) is free. 4. Because the action is still uncertain, test it on a known safe neighbor where the target is verified free – for example, move_up back to the start, then move_right (which can be observed again). 5. If the test shows the agent stays or moves incorrectly, avoid using move_right completely and find an alternative route using only the reliably deterministic actions (move_down, move_up, move_left). 6. Continue issuing exactly one movement function per turn, parsing the returned state each time, and discarding the plan whenever observed positions differ from expectations.\",\n",

It then issued a move_right call. The environment returned a state where the brackets \\\\\"[S]\\\\\" were still at the original start cell, indicating the agent had not moved. The assistant correctly recognized this as a deviation and labeled the action as uncertain. It then called move_down, which succeeded and moved the agent to (row\\u202f2,\\u202fcol\\u202f1). At this point the agent was at a known safe cell. The assistant intended to test the previously uncertain move_right on a safe neighboring cell before using it for progress, as prescribed by the playbook. However, before issuing the test move it failed to verify that the target cell of the right‑move from the current location (row\\u202f2,\\u202fcol\\u202f1) was free. It simply called move_right again, assuming it would move to (row\\u202f2,\\u202fcol\\u202f2). The environment instead moved the agent onto a hazard cell at (row\\u202f3,\\u202fcol\\u202f1) (the brackets now surround an \\\\\"H\\\\\"), terminating the episode. Thus the failure occurred because the assistant did not check the safety of the target cell before executing a move that had already shown uncertain behavior.\",\\n  \"error_identification\": \"The assistant used move_right on a neighboring cell without first confirming that the destination was free. This violated the playbook rule to verify the intended target cell before any move, especially after an action has been marked uncertain. Consequently, the move_right placed the agent on a hazard and terminated the run.\",\\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Conceptual misunderstanding of the uncertainty handling process: the assistant assumed that testing an uncertain action on any neighbor was sufficient, neglecting the explicit check that the neighbor cell is free. This led to an unsafe execution of move_right, turning an already uncertain action into a fatal mistake.\",\\n  \"correct_approach\": \"1. After the first move_right returned the agent still at the start, label move_right as uncertain. 2. Re‑compute a safe path from the actual position (row\\u202f2,\\u202fcol\\u202f1). 3. Before using move_right again, inspect the map and confirm that the cell to the right of the current position (row\\u202f2,\\u202fcol\\u202f2) is free. 4. Because the action is still uncertain, test it on a known safe neighbor where the target is verified free – for example, move_up back to the start, then move_right (which can be observed again). 5. If the test shows the agent stays or moves incorrectly, avoid using move_right completely and find an alternative route using only the reliably deterministic actions (move_down, move_up, move_left). 6. Continue issuing exactly one movement function per turn, parsing the returned state each time, and discarding the plan whenever observed positions differ from expectations.\",\\n  \"key_insight\": \"Never execute a movement function whose behavior is uncertain without first confirming that its target cell is definitely free; always verify the safety of the intended destination before testing or using an uncertain action for progress.\",\\n  \"bullet_tags\": []\\n}\\n\\nCURATION STRATEGY:\\n1. **Identify gaps**: What critical insights from the reflection are MISSING from the playbook?\\n2. **Detect harmful content**: Which bulletpoints led to errors or are marked as harmful?

Good.\\\\n\\\\nThird move_down => state:\\\\n\" S  F  F  F \\\\n F  F [F] H ...\"\\\\nNow brackets at row2,col3? Wait row2 line: \" F  F [F] H\". So position (row2,col3). Good.\\\\n\\\\nFourth move_down => state:\\\\n\" S  F  F  F \\\\n F [F] F  H ...\"\\\\nNow brackets at row2,col2. So moved left? Actually down from (2,3) to (3,3) would be row3,col3 but we got row2,col2 which indicates something odd. Let\\\\\\'s interpret.\\\\n\\\\nAfter third move_down, we were at row2,col3. Then move_down again should go to row3,col3. But state shows brackets at row2,col2. That\\\\\\'s unexpected; move_down behaved unpredictably? Wait maybe parsing wrong: The lines after move_down:\\\\n\\\\nstate: \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F [F] F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \"\\\\n\\\\nLook at row2 line: \" F [F] F  H\". That\\\\\\'s row2 col2 bracket. Row3 line: \" H  F  F  H\". So position now at (row2,col2). That is not down from previous. It moved left? Actually previous location row2,col3 moved left to col2, not down. So the move_down behaved incorrectly (uncertain). According to playbook, after unexpected result, we should label move_down uncertain and verify.\\\\n\\\\nNow we did move_down again (fifth call). State after that:\\\\n\\\\n\" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n[F] F  F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \"\\\\n\\\\nNow brackets at row2,col1. That is moving left again? Starting from (row2,col2) move_down should go to row3,col2 but we got row2,col1. So move_down continues to be uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nThen we called move_right (sixth) from (row2,col1). State after:\\\\n\\\\n\"[S] F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H ...\"\\\\n\\\\nNow brackets returned to start (row1,col1). So move_right moved us up-left drastically? Actually moved to start. Unexpected.\\\\n\\\\nThen move_down again (seventh) from start: state becomes \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n[F] F  F  H ...\" So now at row2,col1 again.\\\\n\\\\nThen move_right (eighth) from row2,col1: state \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F [F] F  H ...\" So now at row2,col2.\\\\n\\\\nThen move_up (ninth) from row2,col2: state \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H ...\" So now at row2,col3.\\\\n\\\\nSo overall current position after nine moves is row2 col3.

Good.\\\\n\\\\nGoal is at row5 col4.\\\\n\\\\nWe have experienced many uncertain moves. Need to proceed carefully. According to playbook: after each action, parse and compare expected vs observed. Most moves have been uncertain. We need to ensure safe navigation: verify that target cell is free before moving. Also, test uncertain actions on known safe neighbor where target verified free before using.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to decide a safe path from current location (row2,col3) to goal (row5,col4) using only moves that we have verified as safe? We have not verified any move deterministic yet. But we can test a move on a neighbor where target is known free. We need map of free cells: Based on initial grid, free cells are all F. Hazard cells: H at positions: (3,1), (3,4), (4,2). Also (2,4) is H? initial row2 col4 H. Yes row2 col4 H. So hazards at (2,4), (3,1), (3,4), (4,2). Goal at (5,4). Starting free cells are many.\\\\n\\\\nCurrent location row2 col3, which is free. Adjacent cells: up to row1 col3 F, down to row3 col3 F, left to row2 col2 F, right to row2 col4 H (hazard). So we must not move right.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to get to row5 col4. Typically path: down, down, down, right. But we need to verify moves down and right safe. Right from row4 col4 is goal (row5 col4?). Actually goal at row5 col4, so we need to be at row5 col3 then right to goal. Need to avoid hazards.\\\\n\\\\nPath could be: from (2,3) down to (3,3) free, down to (4,3) free, down to (5,3) free, right to (5,4) goal.\\\\n\\\\nWe must ensure move_down works reliably. So we should test move_down on a known safe neighbor where target is verified free. For example, from current (2,3) move_down target (3,3) is free. We can test move_down now; but move_down previously behaved uncertain (moved left). So it\\\\\\'s uncertain. We should test it on a safe neighbor where we know target free and observe effect before using for progress.\\\\n\\\\nOne strategy: test move_down on a location where moving down leads to a safe cell we can verify. Perhaps from (2,3) move_up is known? Move_up hasn\\\\\\'t been tried; we could test that first. Up target (1,3) is free. Move_up hasn\\\\\\'t shown behavior; we can test move_up and see result.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to verify a move command\\\\\\'s behavior on a safe neighbor before using it for progression.

Wait parse: state line: \" S [F] F  F\". The brackets now around second cell, which is F. So position now at (row1,col2). That\\\\\\'s move_right succeeded.\\\\n\\\\nSecond move_right call resulted state:\\\\n\" S  F [F] F\"\\\\nNow brackets at third column (col3). So now at (row1,col3). Good.\\\\n\\\\nThird move_down => state:\\\\n\" S  F  F  F \\\\n F  F [F] H ...\"\\\\nNow brackets at row2,col3? Wait row2 line: \" F  F [F] H\". So position (row2,col3). Good.\\\\n\\\\nFourth move_down => state:\\\\n\" S  F  F  F \\\\n F [F] F  H ...\"\\\\nNow brackets at row2,col2. So moved left? Actually down from (2,3) to (3,3) would be row3,col3 but we got row2,col2 which indicates something odd. Let\\\\\\'s interpret.\\\\n\\\\nAfter third move_down, we were at row2,col3. Then move_down again should go to row3,col3. But state shows brackets at row2,col2. That\\\\\\'s unexpected; move_down behaved unpredictably? Wait maybe parsing wrong: The lines after move_down:\\\\n\\\\nstate: \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F [F] F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \"\\\\n\\\\nLook at row2 line: \" F [F] F  H\". That\\\\\\'s row2 col2 bracket. Row3 line: \" H  F  F  H\". So position now at (row2,col2). That is not down from previous. It moved left? Actually previous location row2,col3 moved left to col2, not down. So the move_down behaved incorrectly (uncertain). According to playbook, after unexpected result, we should label move_down uncertain and verify.\\\\n\\\\nNow we did move_down again (fifth call). State after that:\\\\n\\\\n\" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n[F] F  F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \"\\\\n\\\\nNow brackets at row2,col1. That is moving left again? Starting from (row2,col2) move_down should go to row3,col2 but we got row2,col1. So move_down continues to be uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nThen we called move_right (sixth) from (row2,col1). State after:\\\\n\\\\n\"[S] F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H ...\"\\\\n\\\\nNow brackets returned to start (row1,col1). So move_right moved us up-left drastically? Actually moved to start. Unexpected.\\\\n\\\\nThen move_down again (seventh) from start: state becomes \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n[F] F  F  H ...\" So now at row2,col1 again.\\\\n\\\\nThen move_right (eighth) from row2,col1: state \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F [F] F  H ...\" So now at row2,col2.\\\\n\\\\nThen move_up (ninth) from row2,col2: state \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H ...\" So now at row2,col3.\\\\n\\\\nSo overall current position after nine moves is row2 col3. Let\\\\\\'s verify final state:\\\\n\\\\n\" S  F  F  F \\\\n F  F [F] H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \"\\\\n\\\\nYes, brackets at row2 col3 (second row, third column). Good.\\\\n\\\\nGoal is at row5 col4.\\\\n\\\\nWe have experienced many uncertain moves. Need to proceed carefully. According to playbook: after each action, parse and compare expected vs observed. Most moves have been uncertain. We need to ensure safe navigation: verify that target cell is free before moving. Also, test uncertain actions on known safe neighbor where target verified free before using.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to decide a safe path from current location (row2,col3) to goal (row5,col4) using only moves that we have verified as safe? We have not verified any move deterministic yet. But we can test a move on a neighbor where target is known free. We need map of free cells: Based on initial grid, free cells are all F. Hazard cells: H at positions: (3,1), (3,4), (4,2). Also (2,4) is H? initial row2 col4 H. Yes row2 col4 H. So hazards at (2,4), (3,1), (3,4), (4,2). Goal at (5,4). Starting free cells are many.\\\\n\\\\nCurrent location row2 col3, which is free. Adjacent cells: up to row1 col3 F, down to row3 col3 F, left to row2 col2 F, right to row2 col4 H (hazard). So we must not move right.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to get to row5 col4. Typically path: down, down, down, right. But we need to verify moves down and right safe. Right from row4 col4 is goal (row5 col4?). Actually goal at row5 col4, so we need to be at row5 col3 then right to goal. Need to avoid hazards.\\\\n\\\\nPath could be: from (2,3) down to (3,3) free, down to (4,3) free, down to (5,3) free, right to (5,4) goal.\\\\n\\\\nWe must ensure move_down works reliably. So we should test move_down on a known safe neighbor where target is verified free. For example, from current (2,3) move_down target (3,3) is free. We can test move_down now; but move_down previously behaved uncertain (moved left). So it\\\\\\'s uncertain. We should test it on a safe neighbor where we know target free and observe effect before using for progress.\\\\n\\\\nOne strategy: test move_down on a location where moving down leads to a safe cell we can verify. Perhaps from (2,3) move_up is known? Move_up hasn\\\\\\'t been tried; we could test that first. Up target (1,3) is free. Move_up hasn\\\\\\'t shown behavior; we can test move_up and see result.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to verify a move command\\\\\\'s behavior on a safe neighbor before using it for progression. Let\\\\\\'s test move_up from current (2,3).

Start at (0,0). Goal at (4,3). Hazards at certain cells: (1,3), (2,0), (2,3), (3,1). Actually also (??) from grid.\\\\n\\\\nNow we see series of moves:\\\\n\\\\nFirst call move_right: state returned: \" S [F] F  F \\\\\\\\n ...\" Let\\\\\\'s read that line: Row1: \" S [F] F  F\". So we moved right, now current position is second cell (0,1). Good. That cell was F initially, safe.\\\\n\\\\nSecond call move_right: state: \" S  F [F] F\". So moved right again to (0,2). Good.\\\\n\\\\nThird call move_down: state: \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H \\\\\\\\n ...\" So moved down from (0,2) to (1,2). Good.\\\\n\\\\nFourth call move_down: state: \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F [F] F  H \\\\\\\\n ...\" Wait after third move we were at (1,2). Now move_down goes to (2,2). But state shows row2 (index1?) Actually string now: Row1 unchanged, Row2: \" F [F] F  H\". That suggests current position at (1,1). Wait need to parse correctly.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s list each state:\\\\n\\\\nState after third move (move_down):\\\\n```\\\\n S  F  F  F \\\\n F  F [F] H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \\\\n```\\\\nRows indexed 0-4. Brackets at row1? Actually second row (index1) column2 (index2). So position (1,2). Yes correct.\\\\n\\\\nAfter fourth move_down:\\\\n```\\\\n S  F  F  F \\\\n F [F] F  H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \\\\n```\\\\nNow brackets at row1 (index1) column1 (index1). Wait row2 (index1) column1 (index1). That is (1,1). But we expected moving down from (1,2) to (2,2). Why did it go to (1,1)? Something off: maybe move_down moved left? Actually maybe we misread: The environment may have changed due to uncertain behavior. According to playbook, we need to parse each state precisely.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s track step by step with coordinates:\\\\n\\\\nInitial: (0,0).\\\\n\\\\nAfter first move_right: state shows \" S [F] F  F\". That indicates current at (0,1). Good.\\\\n\\\\nAfter second move_right: state \" S  F [F] F\". Current at (0,2). Good.\\\\n\\\\nAfter move_down (third call): state \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H\". That is row2 (index1) column3 (index2) ? Actually string \"F  F [F] H\": columns: col0 F, col1 F, col2 [F], col3 H. So current at (1,2). Good.\\\\n\\\\nAfter fourth move_down: state \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F [F] F  H\". That row2: \"F [F] F H\": col0 F, col1 [F], col2 F, col3 H. So current at (1,1). That means the move_down didn\\\\\\'t go down but left. So uncertain action.\\\\n\\\\nNow after fifth move_down: state \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n[F] F  F  H\". Row2: \"[F] F F H\": current at (1,0). So moved left again. So we are moving left each time we call move_down (uncertain). So we need to treat move_down as uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nAfter sixth move_right: state \"[S] F  F  F\". That placed us back at start (0,0). So move_right moved us left? Actually from (1,0) move_right should go right to (1,1) but got to (0,0). So uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nAfter seventh move_down: state \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n[F] F  F  H\". So back to (1,0) again (move_down from start moved down to (1,0)). So move_down from start behaves correctly (down). But earlier move_down from (0,2) gave unexpected.\\\\n\\\\nNow eighth move_right: state \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F [F] F  H\". So from (1,0) move_right goes to (1,1). That is correct (right). So move_right seems fine now.\\\\n\\\\nNinth move_up: state \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H\". From (1,1) move_up went to (0,1). Good.\\\\n\\\\nTenth move_up: state \" S  F [F] F\". That is from (0,1) up again? Up from top row should maybe stay? It returned (0,2) actually? Wait after ninth, we were at (0,1). Then move_up again (tenth) gave brackets at row1 col2 (0,2). So moving up from top row maybe wraps? Or moved right? Unexpected.\\\\n\\\\nThus many uncertainties.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to reach goal (4,3). We need to find a deterministic safe path using only actions we have confidence in after verification.

So safe cells are all Fs.\\\\n\\\\nWe have observed that move_down from start (0,0) went to (1,0) correctly. Move_up from (0,0) unknown (maybe stayed). Move_right from (0,0) moved to (0,1) correctly earlier but later uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nGiven the uncertainties, perhaps safest is to move using only move_down (vertical) and move_left/right cautiously after verifying target.\\\\n\\\\nWe can test a move on a known safe neighbor where target is known free, as per playbook, before using for progress.\\\\n\\\\nWe are currently at (0,2). Let\\\\\\'s consider moving down towards goal. Need to go down 4 rows and right 1 column.\\\\n\\\\nCheck if moving down from (0,2) is safe: target cell (1,2) currently is F (row1 col2). But we observed move_down earlier from (0,2) gave uncertain result—moved left. So move_down is uncertain when starting at (0,2). We should test move_down on a safe neighbor where we know target is free, perhaps from a different location where we have observed correct behavior (e.g., from start (0,0) move_down worked). Let\\\\\\'s test move_down from (0,0) again to confirm deterministic? Already did earlier; it worked (to (1,0)). So move_down seems to work from start but not from other columns.\\\\n\\\\nThus we cannot trust move_down from our current column.\\\\n\\\\nAlternative: we could move left to column1 then down? Move_left from (0,2) hasn\\\\\\'t been tested. Let\\\\\\'s test move_left from a known safe cell where destination is known free. From (0,2) left target is (0,1) which is F. Move_left hasn\\\\\\'t been used yet. We can test move_left by moving to a safe neighbor where target is free and observe effect. For testing, maybe move_up from (0,2) to (?), but up is uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nBetter: we could move right to column3 then down? Move_right from (0,2) maybe works (we saw earlier move_right from (0,2) gave uncertain earlier but later seemed okay). Actually we haven\\\\\\'t observed move_right from (0,2) after the uncertainties. The last move_right we did was from (1,0) to (1,1). So uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nGiven many uncertainties, perhaps the safest is to reset to start and then attempt a simple path using only move_down and move_right that we have verified one step at a time, testing each before proceeding.\\\\n\\\\nWe are at (0,2). Let\\\\\\'s move back to start (0,0) via left moves. Test move_left from (0,2). Before using, verify target (0,1) is free (it is). So we can attempt move_left.

Goal at (5,4). Free cells elsewhere.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to navigate from (1,2) to (5,4). Let\\\\\\'s find a safe path avoiding hazards. Let\\\\\\'s consider moving down along column2 or column3 etc.\\\\n\\\\nFrom (1,2), safe down moves: (2,2) is F, (3,2) is F, (4,2) is H (danger), (5,2) is F.\\\\n\\\\nSo cannot go through (4,2). Could go right to column3 then down.\\\\n\\\\nCheck (1,3) is F, (2,3) F, (3,3) F, (4,3) F, (5,3) F, then right to (5,4) G. That seems safe (none hazards). Yes hazard at (3,4) but we would stay in column3 until bottom then right.\\\\n\\\\nThus safe path: from (1,2) go right to (1,3); then down 4 times to (5,3); then right to goal.\\\\n\\\\nWe must verify each target is free before moving. Also note that prior moves have been uncertain (e.g., move_right behaved oddly). We should test uncertain moves on a known safe neighbor where target is verified free before using for progress.\\\\n\\\\nWe have currently observed that move_right from (1,2) earlier moved to (1,3) correctly when we did earlier move_right before chaos. However later moves maybe uncertain. To be safe, we should test move_right on a safe neighbor like moving from (1,2) to (1,3) again (target is free). Since we are at (1,2), we can test move_right now; target (1,3) is free. Because action may be uncertain, we can test by first moving up/down? Actually we are already at (1,2). To test move_right, we can move left back to (1,1) then right again? That would test on known safe neighbor. But moving left target (1,1) is S starting cell, free. Let\\\\\\'s ensure (1,1) is free (it was start). So we can move left to (1,1) then move right back to (1,2). But we need to eventually go right to (1,3). So maybe better: check move_right from (1,2) is safe by ensuring target (1,3) free; we already know it\\\\\\'s free. However to be sure of action\\\\\\'s behavior, we could test move_right on a neighbor where we can observe effect without risk: e.g., move_up then move_down. However moving up from row1 would go out of grid (invalid). So cannot test.\\\\n\\\\nThus perhaps we consider move_right as uncertain but destination free, we can attempt moving right directly. If the action misbehaves (e.g., stays, moves elsewhere), we will notice and handle.\\\\n\\\\nGiven we need to minimize risk, perhaps we should first move left to (1,1) then right to (1,2) to test move_right behavior; both target cells are free. Let\\\\\\'s do that: move_left from (1,2) to (1,1). Then move_right back to (1,2). Then move_right again to (1,3) as progress.\\\\n\\\\nWe must ensure after each move we parse state. Let\\\\\\'s proceed.\\\\n\\\\nCurrent state: agent at (1,2) as indicated by \"[S]\"? Actually state shows \"[S]\" at (1,1)? Wait final state after last move_right: \" S [F] F  F\". That shows S at (1,1) and brackets around (1,2) cell? The notation \"[F]\" is bracketed cell where agent stands, and the underlying cell is F (free). The \"S\" appears as a separate character without brackets (maybe start symbol). So agent location is bracketed cell. In final state, row1: \" S [F] F  F\". So agent at (row1,col2).

Let\\\\\\'s parse final state after the last move_right (the most recent):\\\\n\\\\nThe last few moves:\\\\n\\\\n- after some moves: sequence after move_up etc. final state after last move_right:\\\\n\\\\nState: \" S [F] F  F \\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \"\\\\n\\\\nSo agent is back at (row1,col2). So we are stuck near start.\\\\n\\\\nGoal at (row5, col4) (assuming 5 rows, 4 columns). Need to reach G.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to plan safe moves, verifying target cells are free (F). The map static: hazards H at positions: (row2,col4)?, let\\\\\\'s list initial map:\\\\n\\\\nRow1: [S] F F F\\\\nRow2: F F F H\\\\nRow3: H F F H\\\\nRow4: F H F F\\\\nRow5: F F F G\\\\n\\\\nSo hazards at (2,4), (3,1), (3,4), (4,2). Goal at (5,4). Free cells elsewhere.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to navigate from (1,2) to (5,4). Let\\\\\\'s find a safe path avoiding hazards. Let\\\\\\'s consider moving down along column2 or column3 etc.\\\\n\\\\nFrom (1,2), safe down moves: (2,2) is F, (3,2) is F, (4,2) is H (danger), (5,2) is F.\\\\n\\\\nSo cannot go through (4,2). Could go right to column3 then down.\\\\n\\\\nCheck (1,3) is F, (2,3) F, (3,3) F, (4,3) F, (5,3) F, then right to (5,4) G. That seems safe (none hazards). Yes hazard at (3,4) but we would stay in column3 until bottom then right.\\\\n\\\\nThus safe path: from (1,2) go right to (1,3); then down 4 times to (5,3); then right to goal.\\\\n\\\\nWe must verify each target is free before moving. Also note that prior moves have been uncertain (e.g., move_right behaved oddly). We should test uncertain moves on a known safe neighbor where target is verified free before using for progress.\\\\n\\\\nWe have currently observed that move_right from (1,2) earlier moved to (1,3) correctly when we did earlier move_right before chaos. However later moves maybe uncertain. To be safe, we should test move_right on a safe neighbor like moving from (1,2) to (1,3) again (target is free). Since we are at (1,2), we can test move_right now; target (1,3) is free. Because action may be uncertain, we can test by first moving up/down? Actually we are already at (1,2). To test move_right, we can move left back to (1,1) then right again? That would test on known safe neighbor. But moving left target (1,1) is S starting cell, free. Let\\\\\\'s ensure (1,1) is free (it was start). So we can move left to (1,1) then move right back to (1,2). But we need to eventually go right to (1,3). So maybe better: check move_right from (1,2) is safe by ensuring target (1,3) free; we already know it\\\\\\'s free. However to be sure of action\\\\\\'s behavior, we could test move_right on a neighbor where we can observe effect without risk: e.g., move_up then move_down. However moving up from row1 would go out of grid (invalid). So cannot test.\\\\n\\\\nThus perhaps we consider move_right as uncertain but destination free, we can attempt moving right directly. If the action misbehaves (e.g., stays, moves elsewhere), we will notice and handle.\\\\n\\\\nGiven we need to minimize risk, perhaps we should first move left to (1,1) then right to (1,2) to test move_right behavior; both target cells are free. Let\\\\\\'s do that: move_left from (1,2) to (1,1). Then move_right back to (1,2). Then move_right again to (1,3) as progress.\\\\n\\\\nWe must ensure after each move we parse state. Let\\\\\\'s proceed.\\\\n\\\\nCurrent state: agent at (1,2) as indicated by \"[S]\"? Actually state shows \"[S]\" at (1,1)? Wait final state after last move_right: \" S [F] F  F\". That shows S at (1,1) and brackets around (1,2) cell? The notation \"[F]\" is bracketed cell where agent stands, and the underlying cell is F (free). The \"S\" appears as a separate character without brackets (maybe start symbol). So agent location is bracketed cell. In final state, row1: \" S [F] F  F\". So agent at (row1,col2).

Need to reach there while avoiding hazards (H). We don\\'t know if movement deterministic? So far movement seems to work: moving right moves right, left left, down down, up up.

Let\\'s find safe path. Maybe go down to row3col3, then down to row4col3, then down to row5col3, then right to goal (5,4). Check hazards: row4col3 is F, row5col3 is F.

      "  \"reasoning\": \"The assistant began correctly by parsing the initial grid and planning a safe path that avoided the known hazard cells. It executed several moves and updated its internal position based on the brackets in each state. However, after reaching position (row 2, col 3) it planned to move down towards (row 3, col 3) and assumed the move_down action would behave deterministically. The assistant failed to verify that the target cell of the move was indeed free before issuing the command. When move_down was called, the environment returned a state where the agent ended up on a hazard cell at (row 2, col 4) (the brackets surrounded an \\\"H\\\"). This was a direct violation of the playbook rule that requires checking the target cell's safety and treating any action that has shown unexpected behavior as *uncertain*. The assistant never treated move_down as uncertain after its earlier irregular outcomes, nor did it test the action on a known safe neighbor before using it for progress. Consequently it stepped onto a hazard and the episode terminated with failure.\",\n",

It also failed to label the move_down action as uncertain after previous unexpected results and did not perform a safety test on a known safe neighbor before using it for progress.\",\n",
      "  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"A conceptual misunderstanding of the playbook's safety verification step: the assistant assumed deterministic behavior for move_down despite earlier evidence of uncertainty, and omitted the required pre‑move safety check. This led to an unsafe action and immediate termination.\",\n",
      "  \"correct_approach\": \"1. After each move, parse the state and locate the brackets to confirm the exact position. 2. Before issuing any move, look up the target cell in the current map and confirm it is a free (F) cell. 3. If an action has ever produced an unexpected result (e.g., move_down previously moved left), mark it as *uncertain*. 4. Test an uncertain action on a neighboring free cell whose destination is known to be free (e.g., from (2,2) move_right to (2,3) and verify the result) before using it for the main plan. 5. Once the action’s behavior is verified, continue with the safe path: from (2,3) move_down to (3,3), move_down to (4,3), move_down to (5,3), then move_right to the goal. Each step should be preceded by a check that the intended target is free.\",\n",

Wait that\\\\\\'s weird: moving down from (2,3) should go to (3,3). But bracket is at (2,2). So the move_down behaved unexpectedly; the agent moved left instead? Or maybe the environment uncertain. So we need label move_down as uncertain. According to playbook, after deviation, we must treat as uncertain, discard plan, recompute safe path from actual location (2,2). Also we need verify destination cells before moves.\\\\n\\\\nNow after third move_down (the next call we made) gave state:\\\\n```\\\\n S  F  F  F \\\\n[F] F  F  H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \\\\n```\\\\nBracket at (2,1).

We need to reset.\\\\n\\\\nCurrent observed position is (1,1) start again. So we are back at start.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to reach G at (5,4). The map: hazards at positions: (2,4), (3,1), (3,4), (4,2). Also maybe others? From initial: row2 col4 H, row3 col1 H, row3 col4 H, row4 col2 H. That\\\\\\'s it.\\\\n\\\\nGoal at (5,4) safe.\\\\n\\\\nWe have uncertain behavior for all move functions observed. We need to verify safety before using any uncertain action. The plan: we can test an action on a known safe neighbor where destination is free, to see its effect. But we also need to verify that destination is free.\\\\n\\\\nFrom current (1,1). Adjacent safe cells: (1,2) is F, (2,1) is F. Both are free. We can test each direction.\\\\n\\\\nBut we need to know which actions are reliable. We could try to test move_right on a known safe neighbor: from (1,1), moving right to (1,2) safe. But we have already observed move_right earlier: first move_right succeeded from start to (1,2). Then later move_right from (2,1) resulted in moving to (1,1) (up). So action is uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nThus we must verify before using. To test, we can move to a safe cell, then test again.\\\\n\\\\nWe might attempt to find a deterministic move by using move_up/down/left/right but they all seem uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nWe could adopt a conservative approach: only move when we have verified that the particular action moves to expected adjacent cell (by testing on a known safe cell). For example, we are at (1,1). Let\\\\\\'s test move_right: we expect to go to (1,2). We\\\\\\'ll call move_right and see where we end up. If ends at (1,2) that\\\\\\'s good; if not, we treat move_right as unreliable and avoid it.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly test move_down to (2,1). So we need to test each direction and see results. Then we can decide.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s test move_right now (we have just called it and got back to (1,1)?? Wait the last move_right resulted in bracket at (1,1). So move_right from (1,1) resulted in staying at (1,1) instead of moving to (1,2). That\\\\\\'s unexpected; maybe it wrapped?

Let\\\\\\'s parse carefully.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to track each response.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s list them in order with state:\\\\n\\\\n1) After first move_right:\\\\n```\\\\n S [F] F  F \\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \\\\n```\\\\nSo bracket at (1,2). Good.\\\\n\\\\n2) After second move_right:\\\\n```\\\\n S  F [F] F \\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \\\\n```\\\\nBracket at (1,3).\\\\n\\\\n3) After first move_down:\\\\n```\\\\n S  F  F  F \\\\n F  F [F] H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \\\\n```\\\\nBracket at (2,3). Good.\\\\n\\\\n4) After second move_down:\\\\n```\\\\n S  F  F  F \\\\n F [F] F  H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \\\\n```\\\\nBracket at (2,2). Wait that\\\\\\'s weird: moving down from (2,3) should go to (3,3). But bracket is at (2,2). So the move_down behaved unexpectedly; the agent moved left instead? Or maybe the environment uncertain. So we need label move_down as uncertain. According to playbook, after deviation, we must treat as uncertain, discard plan, recompute safe path from actual location (2,2). Also we need verify destination cells before moves.\\\\n\\\\nNow after third move_down (the next call we made) gave state:\\\\n```\\\\n S  F  F  F \\\\n[F] F  F  H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \\\\n```\\\\nBracket at (2,1). So we moved left from (2,2) to (2,1) (since we called move_down again, but got left). So move_down continues to be uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nThen we called move_right, got state:\\\\n```\\\\n[S] F  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \\\\n```\\\\nBracket back at start (1,1). So move_right from (2,1) perhaps moved up? Actually we called move_right, but got to (1,1). That\\\\\\'s weird. So uncertain again.\\\\n\\\\nThus many actions are uncertain now. We need to reset.\\\\n\\\\nCurrent observed position is (1,1) start again. So we are back at start.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to reach G at (5,4). The map: hazards at positions: (2,4), (3,1), (3,4), (4,2). Also maybe others? From initial: row2 col4 H, row3 col1 H, row3 col4 H, row4 col2 H. That\\\\\\'s it.\\\\n\\\\nGoal at (5,4) safe.\\\\n\\\\nWe have uncertain behavior for all move functions observed. We need to verify safety before using any uncertain action. The plan: we can test an action on a known safe neighbor where destination is free, to see its effect. But we also need to verify that destination is free.\\\\n\\\\nFrom current (1,1). Adjacent safe cells: (1,2) is F, (2,1) is F. Both are free. We can test each direction.\\\\n\\\\nBut we need to know which actions are reliable. We could try to test move_right on a known safe neighbor: from (1,1), moving right to (1,2) safe. But we have already observed move_right earlier: first move_right succeeded from start to (1,2). Then later move_right from (2,1) resulted in moving to (1,1) (up). So action is uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nThus we must verify before using. To test, we can move to a safe cell, then test again.\\\\n\\\\nWe might attempt to find a deterministic move by using move_up/down/left/right but they all seem uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nWe could adopt a conservative approach: only move when we have verified that the particular action moves to expected adjacent cell (by testing on a known safe cell). For example, we are at (1,1). Let\\\\\\'s test move_right: we expect to go to (1,2). We\\\\\\'ll call move_right and see where we end up. If ends at (1,2) that\\\\\\'s good; if not, we treat move_right as unreliable and avoid it.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly test move_down to (2,1). So we need to test each direction and see results. Then we can decide.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s test move_right now (we have just called it and got back to (1,1)?? Wait the last move_right resulted in bracket at (1,1). So move_right from (1,1) resulted in staying at (1,1) instead of moving to (1,2). That\\\\\\'s unexpected; maybe it wrapped? So move_right seems now unreliable.\\\\n\\\\nWe need a safe known neighbor to test. Let\\\\\\'s try move_down from (1,1). Call move_down and see where we go.\\'}]), {\\'role\\': \\'tool\\', \\'tool_call_id\\': \\'chatcmpl-tool-b7406907c1ce47b4b59d7cdf6cf7cbfc\\', \\'content\\': \\'{\"state\": \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n[F] F  F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \", \"reward\": 0, \"isTerminated\": false}\\'}, ChatCompletionMessage(content=\\'\\', refusal=None, role=\\'assistant\\', annotations=None, audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=[ChatCompletionMessageFunctionToolCall(id=\\'chatcmpl-tool-396dd0597cd54fc3b3dd51dae5101768\\', function=Function(arguments=\\'{}\\', name=\\'move_right\\'), type=\\'function\\', index=0)], reasoning=\\'We have a sequence of moves.

Start at (0,0). Goal at (4,3). Hazards at certain cells: (1,3), (2,0), (2,3), (3,1). Actually also (??) from grid.\\\\n\\\\nNow we see series of moves:\\\\n\\\\nFirst call move_right: state returned: \" S [F] F  F \\\\\\\\n ...\" Let\\\\\\'s read that line: Row1: \" S [F] F  F\". So we moved right, now current position is second cell (0,1). Good. That cell was F initially, safe.\\\\n\\\\nSecond call move_right: state: \" S  F [F] F\". So moved right again to (0,2). Good.\\\\n\\\\nThird call move_down: state: \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H \\\\\\\\n ...\" So moved down from (0,2) to (1,2). Good.\\\\n\\\\nFourth call move_down: state: \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F [F] F  H \\\\\\\\n ...\" Wait after third move we were at (1,2). Now move_down goes to (2,2). But state shows row2 (index1?) Actually string now: Row1 unchanged, Row2: \" F [F] F  H\". That suggests current position at (1,1). Wait need to parse correctly.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s list each state:\\\\n\\\\nState after third move (move_down):\\\\n```\\\\n S  F  F  F \\\\n F  F [F] H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \\\\n```\\\\nRows indexed 0-4. Brackets at row1? Actually second row (index1) column2 (index2). So position (1,2). Yes correct.\\\\n\\\\nAfter fourth move_down:\\\\n```\\\\n S  F  F  F \\\\n F [F] F  H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \\\\n```\\\\nNow brackets at row1 (index1) column1 (index1). Wait row2 (index1) column1 (index1). That is (1,1). But we expected moving down from (1,2) to (2,2). Why did it go to (1,1)? Something off: maybe move_down moved left? Actually maybe we misread: The environment may have changed due to uncertain behavior. According to playbook, we need to parse each state precisely.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s track step by step with coordinates:\\\\n\\\\nInitial: (0,0).\\\\n\\\\nAfter first move_right: state shows \" S [F] F  F\". That indicates current at (0,1). Good.\\\\n\\\\nAfter second move_right: state \" S  F [F] F\". Current at (0,2). Good.\\\\n\\\\nAfter move_down (third call): state \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H\". That is row2 (index1) column3 (index2) ? Actually string \"F  F [F] H\": columns: col0 F, col1 F, col2 [F], col3 H. So current at (1,2). Good.\\\\n\\\\nAfter fourth move_down: state \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F [F] F  H\". That row2: \"F [F] F H\": col0 F, col1 [F], col2 F, col3 H. So current at (1,1). That means the move_down didn\\\\\\'t go down but left. So uncertain action.\\\\n\\\\nNow after fifth move_down: state \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n[F] F  F  H\". Row2: \"[F] F F H\": current at (1,0). So moved left again. So we are moving left each time we call move_down (uncertain). So we need to treat move_down as uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nAfter sixth move_right: state \"[S] F  F  F\". That placed us back at start (0,0). So move_right moved us left? Actually from (1,0) move_right should go right to (1,1) but got to (0,0). So uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nAfter seventh move_down: state \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n[F] F  F  H\". So back to (1,0) again (move_down from start moved down to (1,0)). So move_down from start behaves correctly (down). But earlier move_down from (0,2) gave unexpected.\\\\n\\\\nNow eighth move_right: state \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F [F] F  H\". So from (1,0) move_right goes to (1,1). That is correct (right). So move_right seems fine now.\\\\n\\\\nNinth move_up: state \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H\". From (1,1) move_up went to (0,1). Good.\\\\n\\\\nTenth move_up: state \" S  F [F] F\". That is from (0,1) up again? Up from top row should maybe stay? It returned (0,2) actually? Wait after ninth, we were at (0,1). Then move_up again (tenth) gave brackets at row1 col2 (0,2). So moving up from top row maybe wraps? Or moved right? Unexpected.\\\\n\\\\nThus many uncertainties.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to reach goal (4,3). We need to find a deterministic safe path using only actions we have confidence in after verification. We should verify each move\\\\\\'s target cell is free before using.\\\\n\\\\nCurrently after tenth move_up, state is:\\\\n```\\\\n S  F [F] F \\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \\\\n```\\\\nBrackets at (0,2). So we are back at (0,2). That\\\\\\'s row0 col2.\\\\n\\\\nGoal at (4,3). Observed hazards: positions with H remain same as initial. So safe cells are all Fs.\\\\n\\\\nWe have observed that move_down from start (0,0) went to (1,0) correctly. Move_up from (0,0) unknown (maybe stayed). Move_right from (0,0) moved to (0,1) correctly earlier but later uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nGiven the uncertainties, perhaps safest is to move using only move_down (vertical) and move_left/right cautiously after verifying target.\\\\n\\\\nWe can test a move on a known safe neighbor where target is known free, as per playbook, before using for progress.\\\\n\\\\nWe are currently at (0,2). Let\\\\\\'s consider moving down towards goal. Need to go down 4 rows and right 1 column.\\\\n\\\\nCheck if moving down from (0,2) is safe: target cell (1,2) currently is F (row1 col2). But we observed move_down earlier from (0,2) gave uncertain result—moved left. So move_down is uncertain when starting at (0,2). We should test move_down on a safe neighbor where we know target is free, perhaps from a different location where we have observed correct behavior (e.g., from start (0,0) move_down worked). Let\\\\\\'s test move_down from (0,0) again to confirm deterministic? Already did earlier; it worked (to (1,0)). So move_down seems to work from start but not from other columns.\\\\n\\\\nThus we cannot trust move_down from our current column.\\\\n\\\\nAlternative: we could move left to column1 then down? Move_left from (0,2) hasn\\\\\\'t been tested. Let\\\\\\'s test move_left from a known safe cell where destination is known free. From (0,2) left target is (0,1) which is F. Move_left hasn\\\\\\'t been used yet. We can test move_left by moving to a safe neighbor where target is free and observe effect. For testing, maybe move_up from (0,2) to (?), but up is uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nBetter: we could move right to column3 then down? Move_right from (0,2) maybe works (we saw earlier move_right from (0,2) gave uncertain earlier but later seemed okay). Actually we haven\\\\\\'t observed move_right from (0,2) after the uncertainties. The last move_right we did was from (1,0) to (1,1). So uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nGiven many uncertainties, perhaps the safest is to reset to start and then attempt a simple path using only move_down and move_right that we have verified one step at a time, testing each before proceeding.\\\\n\\\\nWe are at (0,2). Let\\\\\\'s move back to start (0,0) via left moves. Test move_left from (0,2). Before using, verify target (0,1) is free (it is). So we can attempt move_left.

So move_right seems fine now.\\\\n\\\\nNinth move_up: state \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H\". From (1,1) move_up went to (0,1). Good.\\\\n\\\\nTenth move_up: state \" S  F [F] F\". That is from (0,1) up again? Up from top row should maybe stay? It returned (0,2) actually? Wait after ninth, we were at (0,1). Then move_up again (tenth) gave brackets at row1 col2 (0,2). So moving up from top row maybe wraps? Or moved right? Unexpected.\\\\n\\\\nThus many uncertainties.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to reach goal (4,3). We need to find a deterministic safe path using only actions we have confidence in after verification. We should verify each move\\\\\\'s target cell is free before using.\\\\n\\\\nCurrently after tenth move_up, state is:\\\\n```\\\\n S  F [F] F \\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G \\\\n```\\\\nBrackets at (0,2). So we are back at (0,2). That\\\\\\'s row0 col2.\\\\n\\\\nGoal at (4,3). Observed hazards: positions with H remain same as initial. So safe cells are all Fs.\\\\n\\\\nWe have observed that move_down from start (0,0) went to (1,0) correctly. Move_up from (0,0) unknown (maybe stayed). Move_right from (0,0) moved to (0,1) correctly earlier but later uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nGiven the uncertainties, perhaps safest is to move using only move_down (vertical) and move_left/right cautiously after verifying target.\\\\n\\\\nWe can test a move on a known safe neighbor where target is known free, as per playbook, before using for progress.\\\\n\\\\nWe are currently at (0,2). Let\\\\\\'s consider moving down towards goal. Need to go down 4 rows and right 1 column.\\\\n\\\\nCheck if moving down from (0,2) is safe: target cell (1,2) currently is F (row1 col2). But we observed move_down earlier from (0,2) gave uncertain result—moved left. So move_down is uncertain when starting at (0,2). We should test move_down on a safe neighbor where we know target is free, perhaps from a different location where we have observed correct behavior (e.g., from start (0,0) move_down worked). Let\\\\\\'s test move_down from (0,0) again to confirm deterministic? Already did earlier; it worked (to (1,0)). So move_down seems to work from start but not from other columns.\\\\n\\\\nThus we cannot trust move_down from our current column.\\\\n\\\\nAlternative: we could move left to column1 then down? Move_left from (0,2) hasn\\\\\\'t been tested. Let\\\\\\'s test move_left from a known safe cell where destination is known free. From (0,2) left target is (0,1) which is F. Move_left hasn\\\\\\'t been used yet. We can test move_left by moving to a safe neighbor where target is free and observe effect. For testing, maybe move_up from (0,2) to (?), but up is uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nBetter: we could move right to column3 then down? Move_right from (0,2) maybe works (we saw earlier move_right from (0,2) gave uncertain earlier but later seemed okay). Actually we haven\\\\\\'t observed move_right from (0,2) after the uncertainties. The last move_right we did was from (1,0) to (1,1). So uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nGiven many uncertainties, perhaps the safest is to reset to start and then attempt a simple path using only move_down and move_right that we have verified one step at a time, testing each before proceeding.\\\\n\\\\nWe are at (0,2). Let\\\\\\'s move back to start (0,0) via left moves. Test move_left from (0,2). Before using, verify target (0,1) is free (it is). So we can attempt move_left. If uncertain, we can abort.\\\\n\\\\nProceed: call move_left.\\'}]), {\\'role\\': \\'tool\\', \\'tool_call_id\\': \\'chatcmpl-tool-30b1d5e532094dfe8dac523a20f138bf\\', \\'content\\': \\'{\"state\": \" S [F] F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \", \"reward\": 0, \"isTerminated\": false}\\'}, ChatCompletionMessage(content=\\'\\', refusal=None, role=\\'assistant\\', annotations=None, audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=[ChatCompletionMessageFunctionToolCall(id=\\'chatcmpl-tool-6483087bdd4a4b30b8d8ade53b235e84\\', function=Function(arguments=\\'{}\\', name=\\'move_down\\'), type=\\'function\\', index=0)], reasoning=\\'We have a sequence of moves.

When move_down was called, the environment returned a state where the agent ended up on a hazard cell at (row\\u202f2, col\\u202f4) (the brackets surrounded an \\\\\"H\\\\\"). This was a direct violation of the playbook rule that requires checking the target cell\\'s safety and treating any action that has shown unexpected behavior as *uncertain*.

Test an uncertain action on a neighboring free cell whose destination is known to be free (e.g., from (2,2) move_right to (2,3) and verify the result) before using it for the main plan. 5. Once the action’s behavior is verified, continue with the safe path: from (2,3) move_down to (3,3), move_down to (4,3), move_down to (5,3), then move_right to the goal.

If a function did not behave as expected, this is not because the function is wrong, but due to the uncertain nature of the environment.\\n\\nINPUT DATA:\\n\\nNAVIGATION_TRAJECTORY:\\n[ChatCompletionMessage(content=\\'\\', refusal=None, role=\\'assistant\\', annotations=None, audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=[ChatCompletionMessageFunctionToolCall(id=\\'chatcmpl-tool-d628b10c6e1143e980c7c26313353c7e\\', function=Function(arguments=\\'{}\\', name=\\'move_right\\'), type=\\'function\\', index=0)], reasoning=\\'We need to parse initial state grid.

      "  \"reasoning\": \"The episode began with a correct parsing of the initial grid and a reasonable path plan. The first move_right succeeded, and the model correctly identified that the second move_right behaved unexpectedly (it moved down instead of right) and labeled the action as *uncertain*, as prescribed by the playbook. It then used move_left, which behaved deterministically, and updated its position accordingly. \\n\\nHowever, after moving left the model executed a move_up without first testing it. According to the playbook, after each action the model must compare the observed position with the expected one and, if they differ, label the action as uncertain. The state returned by move_up showed the agent at (row 2, col 2) – a location that could only be reached by moving right from the previous position (row 2, col 1). The model failed to notice this discrepancy and therefore did not mark move_up as uncertain. \\n\\nSubsequently the model proceeded as if all actions were certain, planning a path that used move_right and move_down. It called move_right from (2, 2) to (2, 3), which happened to work as expected, reinforcing the false belief that the action set was deterministic. Then it called move_down from (2, 3) assuming it would move to (3, 3). The environment instead moved the agent right into the hazard cell (2, 4), terminating the episode. The model never tested move_down on a known safe neighbour, nor did it verify the intended target cell was free *after* accounting for the possibility that the action could behave differently.\\n\\nThus the failures stem from:\\n1. Not detecting the unexpected result of move_up (missing the uncertainty detection step).\\n2. Not applying the rule to test uncertain actions on a verified safe neighbour before using them for progress.\\n3. Not re‑verifying the intended target cell after an action had been flagged as uncertain, leading to a move into a hazard.\\n\\nThese missteps directly violated the playbook’s core safety guidelines and caused the navigation to terminate in a hazard.\",\n",
      "  \"error_identification\": \"- Failed to recognize that move_up behaved unexpectedly (the agent moved right instead of up) and therefore did not label it as uncertain. - Ignored the requirement to test uncertain actions (move_up, later move_down) on a known safe neighbor before using them for progress. - Did not verify the intended target cell after each move when an action’s behavior was uncertain, resulting in a move_down that actually moved right into a hazard (cell H).\",\n",
      "  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The model had a conceptual misunderstanding of the playbook’s verification step: it parsed the state but compared it only to the previous position, not to the *expected* position given the commanded action. This led to missing the discrepancy for move_up. Consequently, the model assumed deterministic behavior for subsequent actions, violating the safety rule of testing uncertain actions and checking targets before movement. The error was not a function‑call formatting issue but a misapplication of the safe‑navigation strategy.\",\n",
      "  \"correct_approach\": \"1. After each action, parse the returned state and compare the observed coordinates with the coordinates predicted for that specific action. If they differ, label the action as *uncertain*. 2. Maintain a list of uncertain actions (move_right, move_up, move_down, etc.). 3. Before using any uncertain action for progress, test it on a known safe neighbour whose destination is verified free (e.g., from (2,1) test move_up to see where it actually goes). 4. Only once the actual effect of the action is known should it be incorporated into a new safe path. 5. For each planned move, explicitly check that the target cell (based on the updated map) is free; if the action is uncertain, consider alternative deterministic moves instead of relying on the uncertain action. 6. Re‑plan the path from the *actual* current location after any unexpected movement, avoiding hazards.\\n\\nApplied to this episode: after the unexpected move_up, the agent should have marked move_up uncertain, tested it (e.g., from a safe cell) to discover it actually moves right, and then revised the plan to avoid using move_up. When needing to move down, the agent should have first tested move_down on a safe neighbour (e.g., from (1,3) to see whether it goes down or right) before applying it, thereby preventing the fatal step into a hazard.\",\n",

The first move_right succeeded, and the model correctly identified that the second move_right behaved unexpectedly (it moved down instead of right) and labeled the action as *uncertain*, as prescribed by the playbook. It then used move_left, which behaved deterministically, and updated its position accordingly. \\\\n\\\\nHowever, after moving left the model executed a move_up without first testing it. According to the playbook, after each action the model must compare the observed position with the expected one and, if they differ, label the action as uncertain. The state returned by move_up showed the agent at (row\\u202f2,\\u202fcol\\u202f2) – a location that could only be reached by moving right from the previous position (row\\u202f2,\\u202fcol\\u202f1). The model failed to notice this discrepancy and therefore did not mark move_up as uncertain. \\\\n\\\\nSubsequently the model proceeded as if all actions were certain, planning a path that used move_right and move_down. It called move_right from (2,\\u202f2) to (2,\\u202f3), which happened to work as expected, reinforcing the false belief that the action set was deterministic. Then it called move_down from (2,\\u202f3) assuming it would move to (3,\\u202f3). The environment instead moved the agent right into the hazard cell (2,\\u202f4), terminating the episode. The model never tested move_down on a known safe neighbour, nor did it verify the intended target cell was free *after* accounting for the possibility that the action could behave differently.\\\\n\\\\nThus the failures stem from:\\\\n1. Not detecting the unexpected result of move_up (missing the uncertainty detection step).\\\\n2. Not applying the rule to test uncertain actions on a verified safe neighbour before using them for progress.\\\\n3. Not re‑verifying the intended target cell after an action had been flagged as uncertain, leading to a move into a hazard.\\\\n\\\\nThese missteps directly violated the playbook’s core safety guidelines and caused the navigation to terminate in a hazard.\",\\n  \"error_identification\": \"- Failed to recognize that move_up behaved unexpectedly (the agent moved right instead of up) and therefore did not label it as uncertain. - Ignored the requirement to test uncertain actions (move_up, later move_down) on a known safe neighbor before using them for progress. - Did not verify the intended target cell after each move when an action’s behavior was uncertain, resulting in a move_down that actually moved right into a hazard (cell H).\",\\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The model had a conceptual misunderstanding of the playbook’s verification step: it parsed the state but compared it only to the previous position, not to the *expected* position given the commanded action. This led to missing the discrepancy for move_up. Consequently, the model assumed deterministic behavior for subsequent actions, violating the safety rule of testing uncertain actions and checking targets before movement. The error was not a function‑call formatting issue but a misapplication of the safe‑navigation strategy.\",\\n  \"correct_approach\": \"1. After each action, parse the returned state and compare the observed coordinates with the coordinates predicted for that specific action. If they differ, label the action as *uncertain*. 2. Maintain a list of uncertain actions (move_right, move_up, move_down, etc.). 3. Before using any uncertain action for progress, test it on a known safe neighbour whose destination is verified free (e.g., from (2,1) test move_up to see where it actually goes). 4. Only once the actual effect of the action is known should it be incorporated into a new safe path. 5. For each planned move, explicitly check that the target cell (based on the updated map) is free; if the action is uncertain, consider alternative deterministic moves instead of relying on the uncertain action. 6. Re‑plan the path from the *actual* current location after any unexpected movement, avoiding hazards.\\\\n\\\\nApplied to this episode: after the unexpected move_up, the agent should have marked move_up uncertain, tested it (e.g., from a safe cell) to discover it actually moves right, and then revised the plan to avoid using move_up. When needing to move down, the agent should have first tested move_down on a safe neighbour (e.g., from (1,3) to see whether it goes down or right) before applying it, thereby preventing the fatal step into a hazard.\",\\n  \"key_insight\": \"Always validate the *actual* effect of each action against the *expected* effect immediately after execution; any mismatch must trigger uncertainty handling before any further planning.\",\\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"1326dc23-065d-4f0f-8872-be525c72cd71\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\\n    {\"id\": \"ddf918bd-ceb6-4883-865d-c80fc53bbbef\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"}\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nCURATION STRATEGY:\\n1. **Identify gaps**: What critical insights from the reflection are MISSING from the playbook?\\n2. **Detect harmful content**: Which bulletpoints led to errors or are marked as harmful?

Past episodes show actions may behave unexpectedly. So each move we make we must verify after execution. We cannot pre-test before moving? We could test an action on a known safe neighbor before using for progress. For example, from starting position we could test move_right on a safe neighbor?

Our goal is at (4,3) (row4 col3). Need safe path avoiding hazards. But many actions are uncertain. We need to handle uncertain actions by testing them on safe neighbor before using for progress.\\\\n\\\\nWe have observed behavior:\\\\n\\\\n- move_right: from (0,1) -> (1,1) (down). from (1,1) -> (1,2) (right). from (1,2) -> (0,2) (up). from (0,2) -> (0,3) (right via move_down) Actually move_right not used there. So pattern varied.\\\\n\\\\n- move_down from (0,2) resulted in move right to (0,3). So move_down acted as right.\\\\n\\\\n- move_left seems deterministic (left).\\\\n\\\\nWe have not tested move_up, move_down other contexts, move_up unknown.\\\\n\\\\nWe need to decide next move. Our current position is (0,1). We need to go downwards eventually. Let\\\\\\'s test uncertain actions on a safe neighbor.\\\\n\\\\nWe have a safe neighbor: from current (0,1), left is (0,0) start, which is free. Right is (0,2) free. Down is (1,1) free. Up is out of bounds. We want to test move_down maybe to see its effect. Currently move_down from (0,1) unknown. Let\\\\\\'s test on a known safe cell where destination is verified free; e.g., from (0,1) move_down to (1,1) (free). So we can call move_down now to test its effect. But note that we have already used move_down once (from (0,2) acted as right). That was uncertain. So move_down is uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nThus we label move_down as uncertain and we need to test it on a safe neighbor before using for progress.

Good.\\\\n\\\\nThen move_down: after moving down from (1,4), state shows \"S  F  F [F]\" i.e., row1 col4 becomes [F]? Wait the state: \"S  F  F [F]\\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H...\" So agent at row1 col4? Actually move_down expected to go to row2 col4, which is H hazard. But we saw agent at row1 col4 still? Let\\\\\\'s examine that state: after first move_down (called after being at (1,4)), the state returned:\\\\n\\\\n{\\\\n \"state\": \" S  F  F [F]\\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \"\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nSo the [F] is still at row1 col4 (first row). So move_down had no effect? Or moved but then maybe returned to same? Actually seems move_down did not move; maybe uncertain? According to playbook, we should check if observed position matches expected (row2 col4). It does not; thus move_down is uncertain. We need to label move_down as uncertain. According to reflection earlier, we missed that. Now we must handle uncertainty: before using move_down for progress, test it on a known safe neighbor where destination is verified free. Destination from a safe neighbor? But we don\\\\\\'t know where move_down goes. Could be staying, moving left, etc. We need to test move_down on a safe cell to discover behavior. We have already observed that when at (1,4), move_down did not move. So move_down from (1,4) results in staying in place. So perhaps move_down moves left? Actually we need more testing. Let\\\\\\'s test move_down from a different safe location to see effect.\\\\n\\\\nBut the safe neighbor must have verified free destination. Let\\\\\\'s pick a known safe cell with free neighbor. For example, at (2,1) is F and its down neighbor (3,1) is H hazard, so not safe. Choose (2,2) is F and its down neighbor (3,2) is F free. So we should move to (2,2) safely then test move_down.\\\\n\\\\nCurrent position (3,3). Let\\\\\\'s plan to move to (2,2) to test. But we have to be careful with uncertain actions. move_up seemed uncertain earlier as well? Let\\\\\\'s review: we performed move_up from (3,3) later and got state showing \"S  F [F] F\" after move_up. Wait after move_up we observed: state \"... [F] F\"? That was after we called move_up earlier and got:\\\\n\\\\n{\\\\n \"state\": \" S  F [F] F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \"\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nWhich indicates agent moved from (3,3) to (3,2)? Actually [F] at row1? Wait need to re-evaluate timeline.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s list moves with resulting positions:\\\\n\\\\n1. move_right -> agent at (1,2)\\\\n2. move_right -> (1,3)\\\\n3. move_right -> (1,4)\\\\n4. move_down -> still (1,4) (unexpected)\\\\n5. move_left -> (1,3)\\\\n6. move_left -> (1,2)\\\\n7. move_down -> (2,2) (since after move_down from (1,2) got state \"F [F] F H\"? Actually after move_down from (1,2) we got state: row2 col2 with [F]. Yes position (2,2).\\\\n8. move_down -> (3,2) (state shows row3 col2? Actually after second move_down we saw \"S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H ...\" So agent at row2 col3? Wait need to re-evaluate.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s pull each state in order:\\\\n\\\\nState after 1: \"S [F] F F\" => (1,2)\\\\n\\\\nAfter 2: \"S  F [F] F\"? Actually given: \" S  F [F] F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H ...\" Wait the second after second move_right: state shows \"[F]\" at (1,3). Yes.\\\\n\\\\nAfter 3: third move_right gave \"[F]\" at (1,4).\\\\n\\\\nAfter 4: move_down gave \"[F]\" still at (1,4). So position unchanged.\\\\n\\\\nAfter 5: move_left gave \"[F]\" at (1,3).\\\\n\\\\nAfter 6: move_left gave \"[F]\" at (1,2).\\\\n\\\\nAfter 7: move_down gave state: \"S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F [F] F  H ...\" So agent at (2,2). Good.\\\\n\\\\nAfter 8: move_down gave state: \"S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H ...\" So agent at (2,3) ??? Wait row2 col3 is [F]. Yes (2,3).\\\\n\\\\nAfter 9: move_up gave state: \"S  F [F] F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H ...\" That indicates agent at (1,3). So from (2,3) move_up moved to (1,3). This matches expectation (up works). So move_up seems deterministic.\\\\n\\\\nAfter 10: move_down gave state: \"S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H ...\" So back to (2,3). Good.\\\\n\\\\nAfter 11: move_down gave state: \"S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F [F] H ...\" So agent at (3,3). This matches expectation (down from (2,3) to (3,3)). So move_down seems deterministic except earlier when we were at top row moving down from col4 resulted in staying. Maybe because destination was hazard (2,4) and action prevented moving into hazard? It stayed in place? That might be rule: moving into hazard either fails staying. So move_down is deterministic but cannot move into hazards. So not uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nThus we have reached (3,3). Now goal is at (5,4). Need to navigate avoid hazards.\\\\n\\\\nFrom (3,3), possible moves: down to (4,3) which is F free. Right to (3,4) which is H hazard, cannot go. Left to (3,2) which is F. Up to (2,3) which is F.\\\\n\\\\nWe can go down to (4,3), then down to (5,3), then right to (5,4) goal. Need to ensure moving right from (5,3) to (5,4) is fine (goal). Also need to check moving down from (4,3) to (5,3) is free (yes). So plan: move_down, move_down, move_right.\\\\n\\\\nBut ensure move_down is safe from (4,3) to (5,3). (5,3) is free. So okay.\\\\n\\\\nWe haven\\\\\\'t flagged any uncertain actions now. All actions seem deterministic except move_down into hazard (top). So we can proceed.\\\\n\\\\nCurrent position (3,3).

      "== Response: {\n",
      "  \"reasoning\": \"The assistant’s trajectory began with a correct first move (right) but quickly deviated due to a misinterpretation of the environment feedback. The assistant treated the lack of movement when trying to move down into a hazard as evidence that the `move_down` action was uncertain, when in fact the environment simply prevented moving into a hazardous cell. This misunderstanding led the assistant to incorrectly label several deterministic actions (especially `move_right`) as uncertain, triggering unnecessary testing and back‑and‑forth movements. Additionally, the assistant repeatedly re‑evaluated the whole plan after each move instead of maintaining a simple, direct path once the map was known, resulting in a lengthy and inefficient sequence. Although the final state reached the goal, the reasoning did not follow the playbook’s guidance on parsing the state, correctly distinguishing failed moves due to hazards from true nondeterminism, and on only labeling actions as uncertain when the observed position truly differed from the expected one.\",\n",
      "  \"error_identification\": \"The primary error was a conceptual misunderstanding of the state feedback: interpreting a blocked move (due to a hazard) as an indication of action uncertainty. Consequently, the assistant mislabeled `move_right` and `move_down` as uncertain, performed redundant tests on safe neighbors, and wavered between plans instead of committing to the simple safe path. No function‑call syntax errors occurred, but the strategy selection was inappropriate because the assistant over‑tested actions that were already deterministic.\",\n",
      "  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The root cause was an inaccurate parsing of the grid representation and the brackets. The assistant failed to recognize that the `[F]` bracket always marks the agent’s current cell and that `S` remains a static start marker. It also did not realize that a move that leaves the agent in place is a legitimate “blocked‑by‑hazard” outcome, not an uncertain action. This led to unnecessary uncertainty labeling and redundant navigation steps.\",\n",
      "  \"correct_approach\": \"1. After each function call, parse the returned `state` line‑by‑line, locate the `[ ]` brackets, and record the exact row/column of the agent. 2. Compare the observed position with the expected one; only if they differ should the action be marked *uncertain*. 3. Recognize that a move that leaves the agent in the same cell is caused by a hazard in the intended direction and does not imply uncertainty. 4. Use the verified deterministic actions to construct the shortest safe path (e.g., from the start go right three times, then down four times, avoiding known hazards). 5. If any action truly becomes uncertain, test it once on a verified free neighbor before using it for progress, then resume the plan. This avoids the excessive back‑and‑forth testing and leads directly to the goal.\",\n",
      "  \"key_insight\": \"Always distinguish between a blocked move caused by a hazard and genuine nondeterministic behavior. Correctly parsing the bracketed agent position is essential; only mismatched expected vs. observed positions should trigger uncertainty handling. With accurate state interpretation, simple deterministic planning suffices and unnecessary testing is avoided.\",\n",

Let\\\\\\'s parse: first line: \" S  F  F [F]\" means positions: col1 S, col2 F, col3 F, col4 [F] current. So after move_down, they are still at (1,4).

We must test uncertain actions on known safe neighbor before using for progress. So we should test move_down on a safe neighbor where destination is known free. For example from (2,2) we could test move_down on a safe neighbor like (1,2) (but need to be there). Or we could test move_down from (2,2) itself, but target (3,2) is free. However we haven\\\\\\'t verified move_down works from row2 col2. The earlier move_down from (1,2) succeeded, but move_down from (1,4) failed. So we need to test move_down on a known safe neighbor where destination is free, to see effect.\\\\n\\\\nWe are currently at (2,2). Let\\\\\\'s test move_down now? But that is progress; we should test on a neighbor that we can return? Perhaps we can test move_down from (2,2) and see result. If it moves down to (3,2) as expected, we can then consider it deterministic? According to playbook, we must test on a known safe neighbor BEFORE using for essential progress. Since we are at a location where moving down is part of progress, but we still need to test. However we could test move_down on a different safe neighbor: we could move up to (1,2) (which is safe) then test move_down back to (2,2) which we know is free. But move_up we haven\\\\\\'t tested; it\\\\\\'s unknown behavior (maybe deterministic). Safer: we can test move_down from (2,2) now; even if it misbehaves, we will observe and update map.

Actually formatted:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n S  F  F [F]\\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\n...\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe bracket is at row1 col4? Let\\\\\\'s parse: first line: \" S  F  F [F]\" means positions: col1 S, col2 F, col3 F, col4 [F] current. So after move_down, they are still at (1,4). So move_down behaved unexpectedly (did nothing). So that action is uncertain. Did they label? No, not in analysis. So move_down is uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nThen move_left from (1,4) to (1,3) succeeded (expected) -> deterministic.\\\\n\\\\nThen move_left from (1,3) to (1,2) succeeded.\\\\n\\\\nThen move_down from (1,2) gave state with bracket at (2,2) -> moved down as expected. So move_down from (1,2) works correctly. That suggests move_down may be context-sensitive? It failed earlier maybe due to edge? But we treat move_down as uncertain overall (since at least one unexpected outcome).\\\\n\\\\nThus we have uncertain move_down.\\\\n\\\\nNow we are at (2,2). Need to get to (5,4). Paths: from (2,2) go right to (2,3) then down to (3,3) then down to (4,3) then down to (5,3) then right to (5,4). Need to verify hazards: (2,3) free, (3,3) free, (4,3) free, (5,3) free.\\\\n\\\\nBut uncertain move_down may misbehave. We must test uncertain actions on known safe neighbor before using for progress. So we should test move_down on a safe neighbor where destination is known free. For example from (2,2) we could test move_down on a safe neighbor like (1,2) (but need to be there). Or we could test move_down from (2,2) itself, but target (3,2) is free. However we haven\\\\\\'t verified move_down works from row2 col2. The earlier move_down from (1,2) succeeded, but move_down from (1,4) failed. So we need to test move_down on a known safe neighbor where destination is free, to see effect.\\\\n\\\\nWe are currently at (2,2). Let\\\\\\'s test move_down now? But that is progress; we should test on a neighbor that we can return? Perhaps we can test move_down from (2,2) and see result. If it moves down to (3,2) as expected, we can then consider it deterministic? According to playbook, we must test on a known safe neighbor BEFORE using for essential progress. Since we are at a location where moving down is part of progress, but we still need to test. However we could test move_down on a different safe neighbor: we could move up to (1,2) (which is safe) then test move_down back to (2,2) which we know is free. But move_up we haven\\\\\\'t tested; it\\\\\\'s unknown behavior (maybe deterministic). Safer: we can test move_down from (2,2) now; even if it misbehaves, we will observe and update map. That is acceptable as a test because we are already about to use it for progress, but we treat it as test.\\\\n\\\\nThus we call move_down now.\\'}]), {\\'role\\': \\'tool\\', \\'tool_call_id\\': \\'chatcmpl-tool-58ba42a7548f4e918a48d7173ed276ac\\', \\'content\\': \\'{\"state\": \" S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \", \"reward\": 0, \"isTerminated\": false}\\'}, ChatCompletionMessage(content=\\'\\', refusal=None, role=\\'assistant\\', annotations=None, audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=[ChatCompletionMessageFunctionToolCall(id=\\'chatcmpl-tool-4d02d1af1e864532bbe769a81e539c34\\', function=Function(arguments=\\'{}\\', name=\\'move_up\\'), type=\\'function\\', index=0)], reasoning=\\'We have a long sequence of moves.

Let\\\\\\'s see: after being at row1 col3, move_left gave row1 col2; then move_left again gave row1 col1. That matches expected left.

For example, we could test move_down from a safe cell where the right neighbor is free (since move_down appears to move right). Choose a cell where moving right is safe (i.e., not hazard). For example, at (2,2) right is (2,3) free. But we are now at (2,3), cannot test move_down there because right is hazard. Could move left to (2,2) if move_left works (deterministic). Then test move_down from there, which would move right to (2,3) again; we have already observed that behavior, confirming move_down moves right.

Actually initial S (start) maybe the agent is at [??]. At first move_right, we saw state \"S [F] F F\" meaning we moved to (1,2). Expected move_right works.\\\\n\\\\nSecond move_right: agent at (1,3). Good.\\\\n\\\\nThird move_right: agent at (1,4). Good.\\\\n\\\\nThen move_down: after moving down from (1,4), state shows \"S  F  F [F]\" i.e., row1 col4 becomes [F]? Wait the state: \"S  F  F [F]\\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H...\" So agent at row1 col4? Actually move_down expected to go to row2 col4, which is H hazard. But we saw agent at row1 col4 still? Let\\\\\\'s examine that state: after first move_down (called after being at (1,4)), the state returned:\\\\n\\\\n{\\\\n \"state\": \" S  F  F [F]\\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \"\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nSo the [F] is still at row1 col4 (first row). So move_down had no effect? Or moved but then maybe returned to same? Actually seems move_down did not move; maybe uncertain? According to playbook, we should check if observed position matches expected (row2 col4). It does not; thus move_down is uncertain. We need to label move_down as uncertain. According to reflection earlier, we missed that. Now we must handle uncertainty: before using move_down for progress, test it on a known safe neighbor where destination is verified free. Destination from a safe neighbor? But we don\\\\\\'t know where move_down goes. Could be staying, moving left, etc. We need to test move_down on a safe cell to discover behavior. We have already observed that when at (1,4), move_down did not move. So move_down from (1,4) results in staying in place. So perhaps move_down moves left? Actually we need more testing. Let\\\\\\'s test move_down from a different safe location to see effect.\\\\n\\\\nBut the safe neighbor must have verified free destination. Let\\\\\\'s pick a known safe cell with free neighbor. For example, at (2,1) is F and its down neighbor (3,1) is H hazard, so not safe. Choose (2,2) is F and its down neighbor (3,2) is F free. So we should move to (2,2) safely then test move_down.\\\\n\\\\nCurrent position (3,3). Let\\\\\\'s plan to move to (2,2) to test. But we have to be careful with uncertain actions. move_up seemed uncertain earlier as well? Let\\\\\\'s review: we performed move_up from (3,3) later and got state showing \"S  F [F] F\" after move_up. Wait after move_up we observed: state \"... [F] F\"? That was after we called move_up earlier and got:\\\\n\\\\n{\\\\n \"state\": \" S  F [F] F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \"\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nWhich indicates agent moved from (3,3) to (3,2)? Actually [F] at row1? Wait need to re-evaluate timeline.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s list moves with resulting positions:\\\\n\\\\n1. move_right -> agent at (1,2)\\\\n2. move_right -> (1,3)\\\\n3. move_right -> (1,4)\\\\n4. move_down -> still (1,4) (unexpected)\\\\n5. move_left -> (1,3)\\\\n6. move_left -> (1,2)\\\\n7. move_down -> (2,2) (since after move_down from (1,2) got state \"F [F] F H\"? Actually after move_down from (1,2) we got state: row2 col2 with [F]. Yes position (2,2).\\\\n8. move_down -> (3,2) (state shows row3 col2? Actually after second move_down we saw \"S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H ...\" So agent at row2 col3? Wait need to re-evaluate.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s pull each state in order:\\\\n\\\\nState after 1: \"S [F] F F\" => (1,2)\\\\n\\\\nAfter 2: \"S  F [F] F\"? Actually given: \" S  F [F] F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H ...\" Wait the second after second move_right: state shows \"[F]\" at (1,3). Yes.\\\\n\\\\nAfter 3: third move_right gave \"[F]\" at (1,4).\\\\n\\\\nAfter 4: move_down gave \"[F]\" still at (1,4). So position unchanged.\\\\n\\\\nAfter 5: move_left gave \"[F]\" at (1,3).\\\\n\\\\nAfter 6: move_left gave \"[F]\" at (1,2).\\\\n\\\\nAfter 7: move_down gave state: \"S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F [F] F  H ...\" So agent at (2,2). Good.\\\\n\\\\nAfter 8: move_down gave state: \"S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H ...\" So agent at (2,3) ??? Wait row2 col3 is [F]. Yes (2,3).\\\\n\\\\nAfter 9: move_up gave state: \"S  F [F] F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H ...\" That indicates agent at (1,3). So from (2,3) move_up moved to (1,3). This matches expectation (up works). So move_up seems deterministic.\\\\n\\\\nAfter 10: move_down gave state: \"S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H ...\" So back to (2,3). Good.\\\\n\\\\nAfter 11: move_down gave state: \"S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F [F] H ...\" So agent at (3,3). This matches expectation (down from (2,3) to (3,3)). So move_down seems deterministic except earlier when we were at top row moving down from col4 resulted in staying. Maybe because destination was hazard (2,4) and action prevented moving into hazard? It stayed in place? That might be rule: moving into hazard either fails staying. So move_down is deterministic but cannot move into hazards. So not uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nThus we have reached (3,3). Now goal is at (5,4). Need to navigate avoid hazards.\\\\n\\\\nFrom (3,3), possible moves: down to (4,3) which is F free. Right to (3,4) which is H hazard, cannot go. Left to (3,2) which is F. Up to (2,3) which is F.\\\\n\\\\nWe can go down to (4,3), then down to (5,3), then right to (5,4) goal. Need to ensure moving right from (5,3) to (5,4) is fine (goal). Also need to check moving down from (4,3) to (5,3) is free (yes). So plan: move_down, move_down, move_right.\\\\n\\\\nBut ensure move_down is safe from (4,3) to (5,3). (5,3) is free. So okay.\\\\n\\\\nWe haven\\\\\\'t flagged any uncertain actions now. All actions seem deterministic except move_down into hazard (top). So we can proceed.\\\\n\\\\nCurrent position (3,3).

We have already observed that when at (1,4), move_down did not move. So move_down from (1,4) results in staying in place. So perhaps move_down moves left? Actually we need more testing. Let\\\\\\'s test move_down from a different safe location to see effect.\\\\n\\\\nBut the safe neighbor must have verified free destination. Let\\\\\\'s pick a known safe cell with free neighbor. For example, at (2,1) is F and its down neighbor (3,1) is H hazard, so not safe. Choose (2,2) is F and its down neighbor (3,2) is F free. So we should move to (2,2) safely then test move_down.\\\\n\\\\nCurrent position (3,3). Let\\\\\\'s plan to move to (2,2) to test. But we have to be careful with uncertain actions. move_up seemed uncertain earlier as well? Let\\\\\\'s review: we performed move_up from (3,3) later and got state showing \"S  F [F] F\" after move_up. Wait after move_up we observed: state \"... [F] F\"? That was after we called move_up earlier and got:\\\\n\\\\n{\\\\n \"state\": \" S  F [F] F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  G \"\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\nWhich indicates agent moved from (3,3) to (3,2)? Actually [F] at row1? Wait need to re-evaluate timeline.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s list moves with resulting positions:\\\\n\\\\n1. move_right -> agent at (1,2)\\\\n2. move_right -> (1,3)\\\\n3. move_right -> (1,4)\\\\n4. move_down -> still (1,4) (unexpected)\\\\n5. move_left -> (1,3)\\\\n6. move_left -> (1,2)\\\\n7. move_down -> (2,2) (since after move_down from (1,2) got state \"F [F] F H\"? Actually after move_down from (1,2) we got state: row2 col2 with [F]. Yes position (2,2).\\\\n8. move_down -> (3,2) (state shows row3 col2? Actually after second move_down we saw \"S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H \\\\\\\\n H  F  F  H ...\" So agent at row2 col3? Wait need to re-evaluate.\\\\n\\\\nLet\\\\\\'s pull each state in order:\\\\n\\\\nState after 1: \"S [F] F F\" => (1,2)\\\\n\\\\nAfter 2: \"S  F [F] F\"? Actually given: \" S  F [F] F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H ...\" Wait the second after second move_right: state shows \"[F]\" at (1,3). Yes.\\\\n\\\\nAfter 3: third move_right gave \"[F]\" at (1,4).\\\\n\\\\nAfter 4: move_down gave \"[F]\" still at (1,4). So position unchanged.\\\\n\\\\nAfter 5: move_left gave \"[F]\" at (1,3).\\\\n\\\\nAfter 6: move_left gave \"[F]\" at (1,2).\\\\n\\\\nAfter 7: move_down gave state: \"S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F [F] F  H ...\" So agent at (2,2). Good.\\\\n\\\\nAfter 8: move_down gave state: \"S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H ...\" So agent at (2,3) ??? Wait row2 col3 is [F]. Yes (2,3).\\\\n\\\\nAfter 9: move_up gave state: \"S  F [F] F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H ...\" That indicates agent at (1,3). So from (2,3) move_up moved to (1,3). This matches expectation (up works). So move_up seems deterministic.\\\\n\\\\nAfter 10: move_down gave state: \"S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F [F] H ...\" So back to (2,3). Good.\\\\n\\\\nAfter 11: move_down gave state: \"S  F  F  F \\\\\\\\n F  F  F  H \\\\\\\\n H  F [F] H ...\" So agent at (3,3). This matches expectation (down from (2,3) to (3,3)). So move_down seems deterministic except earlier when we were at top row moving down from col4 resulted in staying. Maybe because destination was hazard (2,4) and action prevented moving into hazard? It stayed in place? That might be rule: moving into hazard either fails staying. So move_down is deterministic but cannot move into hazards. So not uncertain.\\\\n\\\\nThus we have reached (3,3). Now goal is at (5,4). Need to navigate avoid hazards.\\\\n\\\\nFrom (3,3), possible moves: down to (4,3) which is F free. Right to (3,4) which is H hazard, cannot go. Left to (3,2) which is F. Up to (2,3) which is F.\\\\n\\\\nWe can go down to (4,3), then down to (5,3), then right to (5,4) goal. Need to ensure moving right from (5,3) to (5,4) is fine (goal). Also need to check moving down from (4,3) to (5,3) is free (yes). So plan: move_down, move_down, move_right.\\\\n\\\\nBut ensure move_down is safe from (4,3) to (5,3). (5,3) is free. So okay.\\\\n\\\\nWe haven\\\\\\'t flagged any uncertain actions now. All actions seem deterministic except move_down into hazard (top). So we can proceed.\\\\n\\\\nCurrent position (3,3).

The assistant treated the lack of movement when trying to move down into a hazard as evidence that the `move_down` action was uncertain, when in fact the environment simply prevented moving into a hazardous cell. This misunderstanding led the assistant to incorrectly label several deterministic actions (especially `move_right`) as uncertain, triggering unnecessary testing and back‑and‑forth movements. Additionally, the assistant repeatedly re‑evaluated the whole plan after each move instead of maintaining a simple, direct path once the map was known, resulting in a lengthy and inefficient sequence. Although the final state reached the goal, the reasoning did not follow the playbook’s guidance on parsing the state, correctly distinguishing failed moves due to hazards from true nondeterminism, and on only labeling actions as uncertain when the observed position truly differed from the expected one.\",\\n  \"error_identification\": \"The primary error was a conceptual misunderstanding of the state feedback: interpreting a blocked move (due to a hazard) as an indication of action uncertainty. Consequently, the assistant mislabeled `move_right` and `move_down` as uncertain, performed redundant tests on safe neighbors, and wavered between plans instead of committing to the simple safe path. No function‑call syntax errors occurred, but the strategy selection was inappropriate because the assistant over‑tested actions that were already deterministic.\",\\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The root cause was an inaccurate parsing of the grid representation and the brackets. The assistant failed to recognize that the `[F]` bracket always marks the agent’s current cell and that `S` remains a static start marker. It also did not realize that a move that leaves the agent in place is a legitimate “blocked‑by‑hazard” outcome, not an uncertain action. This led to unnecessary uncertainty labeling and redundant navigation steps.\",\\n  \"correct_approach\": \"1. After each function call, parse the returned `state` line‑by‑line, locate the `[ ]` brackets, and record the exact row/column of the agent. 2. Compare the observed position with the expected one; only if they differ should the action be marked *uncertain*. 3. Recognize that a move that leaves the agent in the same cell is caused by a hazard in the intended direction and does not imply uncertainty. 4. Use the verified deterministic actions to construct the shortest safe path (e.g., from the start go right three times, then down four times, avoiding known hazards). 5. If any action truly becomes uncertain, test it once on a verified free neighbor before using it for progress, then resume the plan. This avoids the excessive back‑and‑forth testing and leads directly to the goal.\",\\n  \"key_insight\": \"Always distinguish between a blocked move caused by a hazard and genuine nondeterministic behavior.

      "  \"reasoning\": \"The episode started correctly: the agent parsed the map, identified the start at (0,0) and the goal at (4,3), and chose a safe path (right‑right‑down‑down‑down‑down‑right). The first three moves (right, down, right) behaved deterministically, matching the model’s expectations. The fourth move (down from (1,2) to (2,2)) was the first surprise: the environment returned the agent at (1,1) instead of (2,2). According to the playbook, this discrepancy should have immediately flagged the *move_down* action as **uncertain**, the current plan discarded, and a test of *move_down* on a verified safe neighbor performed before any further progress. Instead, the model continued to use *move_down* for essential navigation, later moving left, up and right in an ad‑hoc manner. It only later tested *move_down* on a known safe cell (row 3 col 2 → row 4 col 2), after which the action behaved as expected. This unnecessary trial‑and‑error added extra steps, but the agent eventually reached the goal.\\n\\nKey divergence points:\\n1. After the unexpected result of the fourth *move_down*, the model failed to label the action uncertain and to test it on a safe neighbour before proceeding.\\n2. The model treated the subsequent *move_down* calls as deterministic again, which caused it to wander back and forth (up, left, right) instead of following the shortest safe path.\\n3. The model did finally recognize the uncertainty later and performed a proper test, but the earlier misuse already incurred wasted moves.\\n\\nOverall, the navigation succeeded, but the inefficiency and extra steps stem from a mis‑application of the uncertainty handling strategy.\",\n",
      "  \"error_identification\": \"The primary error was the mishandling of the first uncertain *move_down* action. The agent did not immediately flag it as uncertain, did not record it, and did not test it on a verified safe neighbour before reusing it for essential progress. This violated the safe navigation playbook and caused unnecessary detours.\",\n",
      "  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Conceptual misunderstanding of the playbook: the model assumed that a single unexpected outcome could be ignored if later moves appeared to work, rather than treating the action as uncertain and testing it on a safe neighbour first. Consequently, the model proceeded with an unverified action, leading to extra, sub‑optimal moves.\",\n",
      "  \"correct_approach\": \"1. After the fourth *move_down* returned an unexpected position, immediately label *move_down* as uncertain and discard the current plan. 2.

Wait state after move_down shows bracket at row2 col2 again, not row3 col3. That indicates moving down from row2 col3 attempted to go to row3 col3 but maybe hazard blocked? Actually row3 col3 is free, but the state shows moved back to row2 col2? Let\\\\\\'s parse: After step3 state: row2 col3 bracket. Then move_down gave state: \"F [F] F  H\" on row2 line, meaning bracket at row2 col2. So the move_down didn\\\\\\'t change position; maybe intended dest (row3 col3) is hazard? But row3 col3 is free per map. Wait maybe coordinate misinterpretation: The grid representation after each move shifts? Let\\\\\\'s view the state after step3: \\\\nState: \\\\n\"S  F  F  F\"\\\\n\"F  F [F] H\"\\\\n\"H  F  F  H\"\\\\n\"F  H  F  F\"\\\\n\"F  F  F  G\"\\\\n\\\\nRow2 col3 bracket (since columns: 1:F, 2:F, 3:[F], 4:H).

Actually maybe we attempted move_down but due to misalignment of coordinate system: maybe move_down moves to next row same column index, but our column index changed? The bracket shifted left one column. That suggests that the environment might have some nondeterminism or my interpretation is off. According to playbook, if observed position differs from expected (expected row3 col3) then action is uncertain. So move_down from (2,3) gave unexpected position (2,2). That\\\\\\'s a mismatch, so we must treat move_down as uncertain now. Should test it on a known safe neighbor before using for progress.\\\\n\\\\nWe have a safe neighbor cell with known free destination: For testing move_down, we need a source where both source and intended destination are known free. Our current location is (2,2). From there moving down to (3,2) is a free cell? Row3 col2 is F (free). So we can test move_down from (2,2) to see its effect.

Then right to (5,4) goal.\\\\n\\\\nWe have already moved right to (2,3) already? Let\\\\\\'s check: After last move we are at row2 col2 again (we moved down then back up?) Sequence: Start row1 col1? Actually start at row1 col1? Initial position [] was start at S? Initially state had \"[ ]\"? The initial state showed \"[ ]\"? It said [S] F ... Actually initial: \"[S] F  F  F\". That indicates start cell (row1 col1) with agent. Then we moved right to (1,2), then down to (2,2), then right to (2,3), then down to (3,3), then up back to (2,3). Wait last move was move_down from (3,3) to (2,3)?? Actually after second move_down we got state where agent at row2 col2 again. Let\\\\\\'s recount:\\\\n\\\\n1. move_right from start (row1 col1) -> row1 col2 (state shows row1 col2 bracket)\\\\n2. move_down -> row2 col2\\\\n3. move_right -> row2 col3\\\\n4. move_down -> row3 col3? Wait state after move_down shows bracket at row2 col2 again, not row3 col3. That indicates moving down from row2 col3 attempted to go to row3 col3 but maybe hazard blocked? Actually row3 col3 is free, but the state shows moved back to row2 col2? Let\\\\\\'s parse: After step3 state: row2 col3 bracket. Then move_down gave state: \"F [F] F  H\" on row2 line, meaning bracket at row2 col2. So the move_down didn\\\\\\'t change position; maybe intended dest (row3 col3) is hazard? But row3 col3 is free per map. Wait maybe coordinate misinterpretation: The grid representation after each move shifts? Let\\\\\\'s view the state after step3: \\\\nState: \\\\n\"S  F  F  F\"\\\\n\"F  F [F] H\"\\\\n\"H  F  F  H\"\\\\n\"F  H  F  F\"\\\\n\"F  F  F  G\"\\\\n\\\\nRow2 col3 bracket (since columns: 1:F, 2:F, 3:[F], 4:H). So row2 col3.\\\\n\\\\nNow after move_down, new state:\\\\n\"S  F  F  F\"\\\\n\"F [F] F  H\"\\\\n\"H  F  F  H\"\\\\n\"F  H  F  F\"\\\\n\"F  F  F  G\"\\\\n\\\\nNow bracket at row2 col2, indicating move down resulted in moving left? Actually maybe we attempted move_down but due to misalignment of coordinate system: maybe move_down moves to next row same column index, but our column index changed? The bracket shifted left one column. That suggests that the environment might have some nondeterminism or my interpretation is off. According to playbook, if observed position differs from expected (expected row3 col3) then action is uncertain. So move_down from (2,3) gave unexpected position (2,2). That\\\\\\'s a mismatch, so we must treat move_down as uncertain now. Should test it on a known safe neighbor before using for progress.\\\\n\\\\nWe have a safe neighbor cell with known free destination: For testing move_down, we need a source where both source and intended destination are known free. Our current location is (2,2). From there moving down to (3,2) is a free cell? Row3 col2 is F (free). So we can test move_down from (2,2) to see its effect. But we just attempted move_down from (2,3) uncertain. Now we are at (2,2). Let\\\\\\'s test move_down again; but we need to verify destination (3,2) is free (yes).

Choose a safe cell adjacent to a free known cell. For example, currently at (1,2). Adjacent safe cells: left (1,1) is free, up (0,2) free, down (2,2) free, right (1,3) is H (hazard). We need to test move_down from a cell where we know target is free. Let\\\\\\'s pick (0,2) maybe? But we need to be at a known safe cell; we can move there via known deterministic actions? We need to identify deterministic actions: move_right from start seemed deterministic (went to (0,1)). move_down from (0,1) to (1,1) deterministic. move_right from (1,1) to (1,2) deterministic. So far those are deterministic. Uncertain: move_down from (1,2). Also earlier we had move_down from (1,1) to (2,1) earlier? Actually after move_right then down we got to (1,1) then right to (1,2).

Let\\\\\\'s see: after uncertain down, we called move_down again (the next action). The state after that move_down shows \"[F]\" at row2 col1? Actually state after that move_down (the 5th move) is: \\\\n\" S  F  F  F \\\\n F  F [F] H \\\\n H  F  F  H \\\\n F  H  F  F \\\\n F  F  F  G\". That indicates agent at row1 col2?

Let\\\\\\'s check: The printed grid shows first line row0, second line row1: \" F [F] F  H\". So agent at row1 col1 again. So move_down from (1,1) kept at (1,1) – blocked by hazard? At (2,1) is F (free). So why didn\\\\\\'t move down? Something off: perhaps the environment indices shift? Actually string: second line after move_down #5: \" F [F] F  H\". That is row1: col0 F, col1 [F], col2 F, col3 H. So still at (1,1). So move_down from (1,1) also unexpected (didn\\\\\\'t move).

The first three moves (right, down, right) behaved deterministically, matching the model’s expectations. The fourth move (down from (1,2) to (2,2)) was the first surprise: the environment returned the agent at (1,1) instead of (2,2). According to the playbook, this discrepancy should have immediately flagged the *move_down* action as **uncertain**, the current plan discarded, and a test of *move_down* on a verified safe neighbor performed before any further progress. Instead, the model continued to use *move_down* for essential navigation, later moving left, up and right in an ad‑hoc manner. It only later tested *move_down* on a known safe cell (row\\u202f3\\u202fcol\\u202f2 → row\\u202f4\\u202fcol\\u202f2), after which the action behaved as expected. This unnecessary trial‑and‑error added extra steps, but the agent eventually reached the goal.\\\\n\\\\nKey divergence points:\\\\n1. After the unexpected result of the fourth *move_down*, the model failed to label the action uncertain and to test it on a safe neighbour before proceeding.\\\\n2. The model treated the subsequent *move_down* calls as deterministic again, which caused it to wander back and forth (up, left, right) instead of following the shortest safe path.\\\\n3. The model did finally recognize the uncertainty later and performed a proper test, but the earlier misuse already incurred wasted moves.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, the navigation succeeded, but the inefficiency and extra steps stem from a mis‑application of the uncertainty handling strategy.\",\\n  \"error_identification\": \"The primary error was the mishandling of the first uncertain *move_down* action. The agent did not immediately flag it as uncertain, did not record it, and did not test it on a verified safe neighbour before reusing it for essential progress. This violated the safe navigation playbook and caused unnecessary detours.\",\\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"Conceptual misunderstanding of the playbook: the model assumed that a single unexpected outcome could be ignored if later moves appeared to work, rather than treating the action as uncertain and testing it on a safe neighbour first. Consequently, the model proceeded with an unverified action, leading to extra, sub‑optimal moves.\",\\n  \"correct_approach\": \"1. After the fourth *move_down* returned an unexpected position, immediately label *move_down* as uncertain and discard the current plan. 2. Record *move_down* in a list of uncertain actions. 3. Move the agent to a verified safe neighbour (e.g., left to (1,1) or up to (0,2)) where the destination of *move_down* is known to be free. 4. Invoke *move_down* from that safe cell to observe its true effect. 5. Once the actual effect is known (e.g., that it moves left instead of down), update the plan accordingly or avoid using *move_down* altogether, using only deterministic moves (right, up, left) to reach the goal via the safe corridor (right‑right‑down‑down‑right). 6. Continue to parse each state, verify target cells, and only use actions whose deterministic behaviour is confirmed.\",\\n  \"key_insight\": \"Whenever an action’s outcome deviates from the expected result, treat that action as uncertain immediately, record it, and test it on a known safe neighbour before ever using it for essential navigation. This prevents cascading errors and keeps the agent on the shortest safe path.\",\\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\\n    {\"id\": \"1326dc23-065d-4f0f-8872-be525c72cd71\", \"tag\": \"helpful\"},\\n    {\"id\": \"ddf918bd-ceb6-4883-865d-c80fc53bbbef\", \"tag\": \"harmful\"}\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nCURATION STRATEGY:\\n1. **Identify gaps**: What critical insights from the reflection are MISSING from the playbook?\\n2. **Detect harmful content**: Which bulletpoints led to errors or are marked as harmful? Use REMOVE or MODIFY.\\n3. **Eliminate redundancy**: Find similar or overlapping bulletpoints and merge them using MODIFY + REMOVE.\\n4. **Assess complementarity**: If advice similar to a new insight exists, only ADD if it meaningfully extends existing guidance. Otherwise, use MODIFY to enhance the existing entry.\\n5. **Prioritize quality**: A focused, coherent playbook beats an exhaustive one.

      "  \"reasoning\": \"The assistant started with a correct map interpretation and a safe five‑step plan (right‑right‑down‑down‑down‑down‑right). However, after each function call it failed to parse the returned state correctly. The first `move_right` left the agent at the start ([S] still at (0,0)), but the assistant assumed the move succeeded and did not update its internal position. The second `move_right` finally moved the agent to (0,1), but the assistant still believed it was at the start. When the third `move_right` was issued, the environment moved the agent down to (1,1) instead of right to (0,2). The assistant recognised the unexpected outcome, labeled the action as *uncertain*, but instead of discarding the original plan and recomputing a new safe path from the new location, it simply tested the same `move_right` again. Because the action was uncertain, the test moved the agent from (1,1) to a hazard cell at (1,3) (H), causing termination. Throughout, the assistant never verified the target cell of each intended move against the updated map before issuing the command, violating the core rule of the safe navigation strategy. Consequently, the plan was never adjusted after the first divergence, leading directly to a fatal move into a hazard.\",\n",
      "  \"error_identification\": \"1. Misreading the state after the first `move_right` (agent remained at start but was assumed to have moved). 2. Failing to verify the intended target cell before each move, violating the “verify target is free” rule. 3. After detecting an unexpected outcome, the assistant did not discard the original plan or recompute a new safe path, contrary to the playbook. 4. The uncertain `move_right` was tested on a neighboring cell without first confirming its actual effect; the test itself moved the agent into a hazard, breaching the “test on known safe neighbor whose destination is verified free” guideline.\",\n",
      "  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The primary root cause is a conceptual misunderstanding of the playbook's feedback loop: the assistant treated the environment’s response as deterministic and kept using the same action without updating its internal position or re‑evaluating the map. This led to an incorrect belief that the target cell was free and that the same action could be safely reused, ignoring the required step of recomputing a path after any divergence.\",\n",
      "  \"correct_approach\": \"1. After each movement function, immediately parse the `state` string, locate the brackets, and update the agent’s coordinates. 2. Compare the observed coordinates with the expected ones. If they differ and the cell the agent *intended* to move into is free, mark the action as uncertain, discard the current plan, and run the path‑finding algorithm again from the *actual* position. 3. Before issuing any move, check the updated map to ensure the destination cell is not a hazard. 4. If an action is marked uncertain, first test it on a *known* safe neighboring cell whose destination has been verified free; only after observing the test outcome should you consider using it for progress. 5. In this scenario, after the third `move_right` unexpectedly sent the agent to (1,1), the assistant should have stopped, recomputed a new safe route from (1,1) (e.g., right → (1,2), down → (2,2), down → (3,2), down → (4,2), right → goal) and then proceeded with verified moves.\",\n",
      "  \"key_insight\": \"Always treat the environment feedback as authoritative: update the agent’s position after every action, verify the next cell’s safety, and if any action produces an unexpected result, abort the current plan and re‑plan from the new location before attempting further moves.\",\n",

However, after each function call it failed to parse the returned state correctly. The first `move_right` left the agent at the start ([S] still at (0,0)), but the assistant assumed the move succeeded and did not update its internal position. The second `move_right` finally moved the agent to (0,1), but the assistant still believed it was at the start. When the third `move_right` was issued, the environment moved the agent down to (1,1) instead of right to (0,2). The assistant recognised the unexpected outcome, labeled the action as *uncertain*, but instead of discarding the original plan and recomputing a new safe path from the new location, it simply tested the same `move_right` again. Because the action was uncertain, the test moved the agent from (1,1) to a hazard cell at (1,3) (H), causing termination. Throughout, the assistant never verified the target cell of each intended move against the updated map before issuing the command, violating the core rule of the safe navigation strategy. Consequently, the plan was never adjusted after the first divergence, leading directly to a fatal move into a hazard.\",\\n  \"error_identification\": \"1. Misreading the state after the first `move_right` (agent remained at start but was assumed to have moved). 2. Failing to verify the intended target cell before each move, violating the “verify target is free” rule. 3. After detecting an unexpected outcome, the assistant did not discard the original plan or recompute a new safe path, contrary to the playbook. 4. The uncertain `move_right` was tested on a neighboring cell without first confirming its actual effect; the test itself moved the agent into a hazard, breaching the “test on known safe neighbor whose destination is verified free” guideline.\",\\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The primary root cause is a conceptual misunderstanding of the playbook\\'s feedback loop: the assistant treated the environment’s response as deterministic and kept using the same action without updating its internal position or re‑evaluating the map. This led to an incorrect belief that the target cell was free and that the same action could be safely reused, ignoring the required step of recomputing a path after any divergence.\",\\n  \"correct_approach\": \"1. After each movement function, immediately parse the `state` string, locate the brackets, and update the agent’s coordinates. 2. Compare the observed coordinates with the expected ones. If they differ and the cell the agent *intended* to move into is free, mark the action as uncertain, discard the current plan, and run the path‑finding algorithm again from the *actual* position. 3. Before issuing any move, check the updated map to ensure the destination cell is not a hazard. 4. If an action is marked uncertain, first test it on a *known* safe neighboring cell whose destination has been verified free; only after observing the test outcome should you consider using it for progress. 5. In this scenario, after the third `move_right` unexpectedly sent the agent to (1,1), the assistant should have stopped, recomputed a new safe route from (1,1) (e.g., right → (1,2), down → (2,2), down → (3,2), down → (4,2), right → goal) and then proceeded with verified moves.\",\\n  \"key_insight\": \"Always treat the environment feedback as authoritative: update the agent’s position after every action, verify the next cell’s safety, and if any action produces an unexpected result, abort the current plan and re‑plan from the new location before attempting further moves.\",\\n  \"bullet_tags\": [\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"1326dc23-065d-4f0f-8872-be525c72cd71\",\\n      \"tag\": \"helpful\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"id\": \"ddf918bd-ceb6-4883-865d-c80fc53bbbef\",\\n      \"tag\": \"helpful\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nCURATION STRATEGY:\\n1. **Identify gaps**: What critical insights from the reflection are MISSING from the playbook?\\n2. **Detect harmful content**: Which bulletpoints led to errors or are marked as harmful? Use REMOVE or MODIFY.\\n3. **Eliminate redundancy**: Find similar or overlapping bulletpoints and merge them using MODIFY + REMOVE.\\n4. **Assess complementarity**: If advice similar to a new insight exists, only ADD if it meaningfully extends existing guidance. Otherwise, use MODIFY to enhance the existing entry.\\n5. **Prioritize quality**: A focused, coherent playbook beats an exhaustive one. Fewer, better bulletpoints.\\n\\nDECISION CRITERIA:\\n\\n**When to ADD:**\\n- New strategy or insight completely absent from playbook\\n- Novel pattern or mistake type not covered\\n- Complementary detail that significantly extends existing advice\\n\\n**When to MODIFY:**\\n- Existing bulletpoint needs refinement or clarification\\n- Similar advice exists but lacks key details from the reflection\\n- Bulletpoint is partially helpful but contains flawed reasoning\\n\\n**When to REMOVE:**\\n- Bulletpoint is harmful (confirmed by reflection or harmful tag count)\\n- Content is redundant with other entries\\n- Advice is too vague or not actionable\\n\\n**When to do NOTHING:**\\n- Playbook already covers all insights from the reflection\\n- No harmful or redundant content detected\\n- Current playbook is coherent and complete\\n\\nQUALITY GUIDELINES:\\n- Be specific and actionable\\n- Ground advice in observable feedback, not ground truth\\n- Focus on generalizable strategies that transfer across changing environments\\n- Avoid layout-specific advice (environment layout changes between runs)\\n- Each bulletpoint should address one clear concept or strategy\\n'}]\n",
