# llm-worldmodel-lab
This workspace explores diffrent worldmodels for an llm trying to navigate an uncertain environment.
The current architecture is based on the [ACE Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04618).
Please note that the current prompts are not perfect. Especially for the curator and reflector.
